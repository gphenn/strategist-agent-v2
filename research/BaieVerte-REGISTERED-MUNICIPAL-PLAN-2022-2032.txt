# Baie Verte Registered Municipal Plan (2022 - 2032)

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION 

### 1.1 The Purpose of the Municipal Plan 

The purpose of the Municipal Plan, 2022-2032 is to enable the community to pursue sustainable choicesI to meet the needs of the Town for the next 10 years. This updated Municipal Plan will replace the current Municipal Plan, 1984-1994 which was gazetted on November 1, 1985 {which replaced the previous 1977 plan). 

This updated plan provides an up to date, comprehensive policy framework to influence, manage, and regulate future growth and change in the Town of Baie Verte. 

###1.2 Authority

The Municipal Plan and Development Regulations are legal documents created under the authority of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000. They apply throughout the Municipal Planning Area which is established under the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000; note that the Municipal Planning Area boundary is the same as the Municipal Area boundary under the Municipalities Act, 1999.
 
The policies and development requirements contained in the documents and mapping are binding uponI the Town Council, residents and on any person undertaking a development within the Municipal Planning Area boundary {Section 12 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000). 

The Municipal Plan guides the future growth and physical improvement of the Town by identifying locations and setting out policies for various types of land use development. These locations are shown as land use designations on the Future Land Use map found in the appendices. 

The Municipal Plan authorizes Council to prevent the undertaking of any development that contravenes a policy stated in the Municipal Plan. 

The Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000 requires the preparation of Development Regulations to ensure that land is controlled and used in compliance with the Plan {Section 35); these form a separate companion document to the plan. The Development Regulations enable the Council to administer the policies of the Municipal Plan. The Municipal Plan provides the basis for the Development Regulations which provide more refined zoning within the land use designations indicating permitted and discretionary uses in each zone, development standards and conditions, and criteria for the evaluation of subdivision and development applications. The land use designation and zones apply on both public and private land. 

The Municipal Plan 2022-2032 that comes into legal effect upon publication of the notice of registration 
in the Newfoundland and Labrador Gazette, and at that point the Municipal Plan, 1984-1994, is repealed 
and replaced by the new Municipal Plan, 2022-2032. 

### 1.3 The Municipal Planning Process

The process for preparing a plan is set out in Part 111of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000 (Sections 14 -25) and it can only be undertaken by a certified planner in good standing with the Canadian Institute of Planners.

A Background Report was prepared to inform the Municipal Plan review. It provides the key findings of statistical research, community site visits and discussions with the Town staff and Council, a questionnaire to elicit resident preferences and concerns, information gleaned from Provincial agencies and community representatives, including public consultation.

The Background Report contains a review of land use, development and infrastructure servicing issues, and a socio-economic profile of the Town of Baie Verte. As well, an analysis was undertaken of the 1984 planning documents and mapping. The Background Report provides the foundation for preparation of the plan update. It can be found in the appendices.

As part of the planning process, the Local Governance and Land Use Planning Division circulates the proposed planning documents and mapping to other government agencies through the Interdepartmental Land Use Committee (ILUC). These specific requirements are also integrated into the planning documents. As this ILUC report is an internal government document, it cannot be reproduced in the Municipal Plan.

An important part of this process is the public consultation requirements which ensure that residents and stakeholders have adequate access to information regarding land use and development regulation proposals including an adequate opportunity to respond to these proposals. There are a minimum of three key opportunities for public participation:
 
#### at the outset of the plan review project to solicit ideas and concerns of residents, stakeholders, business owners, Council and Town staff (Community survey-195 responses; Public Consultation session on September 16, 2020; Meetings with Council, staff and community representatives; 

#### when the draft proposed planning documents and maps are ready for provincial review under Section 15 (Public consultation session with presentation-June 15, 2021); and, 

#### the Public Hearing, where an independent Commissioner can hear objections or submissions regarding the planning documents and maps released from the Section 15 review and adopted by Council. 

The Municipal Plan must address the future land use and development of the Municipal Planning Area for a 10-year period. The Municipal Plan must be reviewed every five years (Section 28}, and reviewed comprehensively again at 10 years' time as the scope of the plan is required to anticipate the needs of the Town of Baie Verte for a 10-year period.

Amendments can be made to the Municipal Plan and Development Regulations at any time. Amendments must follow the procedure (Sections 14-25} set out in the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000 (Section 25).

Note that a Resolution of Council alone cannot amend (or circumvent) a requirement contained in the Municipal Plan or Development Regulations. 

### 1.4 Organization of the Plan

The Municipal Plan is organized into five chapters: 
**Chapter 1** sets the legal context of the planning process; 
**Chapter 2** sets out the Objectives for of the Town of Baie Verte that apply generally throughout the community to achieve sustainability;

## 4.2 Provincial and Federal Interests
 
In preparation for the Municipal Plan Review, the Local Governance and Planning Division referred the Town of Baie Verte review notice to the Interdepartmental Land Use Committee (ILUC). ILUC consists of about 16 government departments and agencies with land use and development jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding the general compliance policy regarding all federal and provincial statutes, regulations, policies and guidelines, it is the policy of Council to: 
1) Climate Change: Take into consideration available data regarding provincial climate change projections for the nearest regional sites when considering land for future developments that are in close proximity to a river, floodplain or coastline. These projections suggest that extreme precipitation events will become more intense, by about 25%. Climate change is expected to result in more precipitation and more frequent extreme weather events that may result in increased flooding, sea surge and coastal erosion. These factors should be considered when allocating land for future developments that are in close proximity to a river, floodplain or coastline; 
2) Archaeology: Any public works project or major land development that results in ground disturbance must be sent to Provincial Archaeology Office (PAO) for review. As well, any accidental discoveries of historic resources should also be reported to the PAO. Before approval is granted for a major development such as a subdivision or a new commercial or public building, the application shall be referred to the Provincial Archaeology Office for comments. 
3) GIS & Mapping: Inform the GIS & Mapping Division when a proposed development is proposed in the vicinity of a Survey Control Monument. There are 18 survey monuments in the Municipal Planning Area. The locations of the survey control markers can be viewed at: https://arcg.is/lrWnSC and they are set out on the Future Land Use and Land Use zoning maps . Any development applications occurring in the vicinity of these markers must be referred to the GIS & Mapping Division; 
4) Agriculture: Consult with the Land Resource Stewardship Division regarding commercial agricultural development applications; Set out the Agricultural Development Area (ADA) on the Future Land Use and Land Use zoning maps and require that all applications within the ADA be referred to the Land Resources Stewardship Division for comment. 
5) Mineral Resource Lands: 
a. 300 Quarry buffer: Map this referral buffer as an overlay on the Future Land Use map and the Land Use Zoning map and require all proposed development applications within the 300 metre buffer to be referred to the Mineral Lands Division for approval; 
b. Indicate that mineral exploration that is not a development is allowed as a permitted use in all zones and that mineral exploration that is a development is indicated as a discretionary use; and development requirements regarding potential mining should be incorporated into the regulations; 
c. Include the Mineral Lands Division definitions for Mineral Exploration, Mineral Working and Mining in the Development Regulations;

c. Where fish habitat is affected, requiring appropriate approvals from Fisheries and Oceans Canada; 
d. Maintaining, where possible, existing vegetation along banks and shorelines for protection of riparian habitat; 
8) Forestry 
a. Forestry activities are: 
i. a permitted use in the Rural zone, including domestic harvesting; 
ii. a discretionary use in the Environmental Protection and, 
iii. subject to the policy in 7 (a) (iv) as a discretionary use in the Protected Water Supply zone. 
9) NL Hydro 
a. Provide a definition of easements for public utilities will be set out in the Development Regulations and: 
i. no development, including quarrying, will be allowed in these easements; and, 
ii. Access by service providers will be protected. 
b. As part of the application review process, refer new development applications to NL Hydro and approval must be received prior to construction commencing; 
10) Wildlife 
a. Consider the services of staff involved with in the Wildlife Division who work with the Eastern Habitat Joint Venture to discuss the incorporation of wildlife and conservation values in municipal plans and associated development regulations. 
b. Address general wildlife habitat and landscape connectivity during application review, with the following standards:

� Adopt Development Regulations as a tool for administration and implementation; 
� Issue development permits for new development, change of use, or to subdivide land, in accordance with the Development Regulations; 
� Implement a Capital Works program consistent with the Municipal Plan policies; 
� Ensure a clear and efficient approach to the development review, decision-making, and appeal processes; and, 
� Undertake to conduct research to inform decision-making in Plan implementation. 

Development Regulations are one of the main vehicles through which Plans are implemented. The Town will review, revise and adopt Development Regulations pursuant to Section 35 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000. 

## 5.2 Amendments to the Plan 

Council may consider amendments to the Municipal Plan when: 
1. There have been significant changes to the community since the preparation of the Background Report that provided the factual basis for the policies in this Municipal Plan; 
2. Studies have been undertaken by the Town or the Provincial or Federal governments which contain recommendations or policies which should be incorporated into the Municipal Plan; 
3. A development proposal is submitted to Council which provides sufficient information and rationale to support a change in the Municipal Plan;

In considering any proposed amendment to the Plan, the Council should evaluate the proposal for consistency with the strategy for growth of the Town, as established in the goals, objectives and policies of the Municipal Plan. An associated amendment may be required to the Development Regulations. As per Section 25 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000, an amendment to the Municipal Plan (and an amendment to the Municipal Plan and Development Regulations) must follow the process set out in Sections 14 -25 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000. Council is not bound to make an amendment and this decision is not appealable under Part VI of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000.

A person may request to have the zoning of a parcel of land changed in order to accommodate a use or development not permitted under its' current zoning. This might only require an amendment to the Development Regulations without amendment to the Municipal Plan. Alternatively, a Development Regulations amendment may consist of a change to the text of the regulations. In considering requests for Development Regulation amendments, Council shall consider: 
� all appropriate policies set out in this Plan; 
� the provision of road, water and sanitary and storm sewer services and the impact on existing infrastructure; 
� the fiscal impact of the development on the Town; 
� community/neighbourhood context for the proposed development; 
� environmental considerations, emissions, effluents, nuisance effects; and, 
� site suitability: slope, groundwater, location of watercourses and wetlands. 

The procedure for an amendment to the Development Regulations only is set out in the Development Regulations. 

## 5.3 Review of the Plan

The Council for the Town of Baie Ve rte will undertake a review of the Municipal Plan every five years in accordance with the requirements of Section 28 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000. This review may be comprehensive or it may consist of an audit of progress that confirms that the Plan is still relevant. The review process is valuable to the Council and residents to ensure that the administration of the community achieves the objectives of its residents.

## 1.0 Introduction 

## 1.1

**Town of Baie Verte Municipal Planning Area**

The Town of Baie Verte, with a population of approximately 1,315, is located on the Baie Verte 
Peninsula in the Central North Coast Area of the province, approximately 45 km from the Trans.Canada Highway #1. Baie Verte is approximately 160 km from the Town of Deer Lake where I there is a regional airport, 270 km from the Town of Gander where there is an international airport. The town is 425 km to Port aux Basque for the ferry service to the mainland. There is also a port nearby, Point Rousse facility, which services the mining operations. The Town was incorporated as a town in 1958. The Baie Verte Municipal Planning area borders the major mining operation at the Pine Cove open pit mine, Mill and tailings facility, the Stog'er Tight and Argyle deposits (and approximately 5,800 hectares of prospective gold-bearing property) which are operated by Anaconda Mining, a TSX-listed gold mining company. The town serves as a regional service centre for towns on the northern tip of the Baie Verte peninsula. 

The Baie Verte Municipal Planning Area established under the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000 and providing land use planning authority is the same as the Town's Municipal Area Town established under the Municipalities Act, 1990 which provides taxation authority amongst many other municipal powers. 

The current Municipal Plan and Development Regulations, 1984-1994 was prepared by the Land Use Planning Division of the Department of Municipal and Provincial Affairs. Needless to say, after 36 years, the Town is in need of an updated plan and regulations to help Council meet the needs of the community. 

**History and Geography**
Baie Verte's history goes back to the days of the 'French Shore' when French fishermen went there to cut wood. The French named the area for its greenness, "green bay." Although the French controlled the area until 1904, English families were fishing and farming there as early as the 1879's. 

A copper and sulphur mine, Terra Nova Mine, opened near Baie Verte in the 1850s, and mining and lumbering were the main occupations of the community until the mine closed in about 1915. By the turn of the century fishing had been generally abandoned by the residents as the effort involved in getting to the fishing grounds was too great. Around 1938, the forestry company, Bowater Pulp and Paper Company, commenced harvesting in the area and forestry became the economic mainstay and 1961 there were over 900 residents in the Town Mining again became important in 1963 when Advocate Mines Ltd began asbestos operations, and shortly afterwards Consolidated Rambler began mining copper again. By the late 1970s half the labour force was employed in mining, and the town populations was over 2500 in 1976. The mine closed in 1982 (but was open sporadically between 1995-98. Consolidated Rambler then briefly ran the Nugget Pond gold mine from 1997-2001. 

In the late 2000s, Anaconda opened the Pine Cove gold mine (2008) and reopened the former Nugget Pond mine to process gold-bearing ore from Greenland (2007). Forestry industries continued to offer some employment. 

Meanwhile, the Town of Baie Verte remained the main service centre on the peninsula. It also became the home to a campus of College of the North Atlantic. Tourism increased in importance as part of the Dorset Trail and the Miners' Museum (which features a mining tunnel). Other attractions in the area include the Dorset Soapstone Quarry at Fleur de Lys, 29 km north of Baie Verte and hiking trails with beaches and lighthouses in the region. 

## 2.0 Demographics and Economy 

##2.1 The People 

In 2016, the population of Baie Verte was 1,315, about a 50% decrease since the first municipal plan was prepared in the mid-1980's when the 1981 population was 2,692. However, lifestyles and expectations regarding community services and amenities have changed dramatically in the past 36 years. 

The changes to the Municipal Plan need to reflect the changes in the demographic profile of the community. To look at this more closely, the population of the town was examined by age groups over the past 20 years, as shown on the figure below. By this time, the change in 
population from 1996 of 1,620 residents to 1,315 residents in 2016 represents a decrease of 24%. It should be noted that the decrease between 1996-2006 was greater, but that the overall population actually grew from 1,275 in 2006 to the 1,315 in 2016. The question is whether this constitutes a trend for the future? Which age groups are growing and what services do they 
need? Are the amenities of 2006 sufficient or suitable to deal with the needs of 2016? 

```Chart
Population change by Age groups, 1996-2016
```

First of all, in these 30 years, the greatest drop in the number of residents occurred between 1996 and 2006, and secondly, the population actually increased between 2006 to 2016. This pattern is strongly evident for the 25-44-year-olds who represent the prime younger work force, and in the 0-4 and5-14-year-olds who would be their children. 

Consistent with the overall aging population of the province as a whole, the Town of Baie Ve rte is also experiencing growth for all age groups over 55 years of age since 2016. What was interesting between 2006 and 2016 was that children aged 0-4 and 5-14 increased slightly, while teenagers (15-19) decreased dramatically while 20-24-year-olds (post-secondary) remained stable. 

This would indicate that the Town needs to assess whether the community amenities for children continue to meet their needs and whether there are more amenities needed by seniors that can be provided by the Town. For more detailed household analysis, only the past 10-year period was used wherever Statistics Canada categories were clearly the same (data collection definitions change from one census to the next). 

The 2016 Census indicates that the average household size is 2.3 persons, down from 2.7 in 2006 even though the population increased during this time. This is reflected in the Table below regarding number of people in households.

In 2016, 22% of the households are only 1-person households (as compared to 16% in 2006) and 45% are 2-person households. 

| Private households by household size  | 2006  | 2011  | 2016 |
|--|--|--|--|
| Total  | 480 | 535 | 545 |
| 1 person | 75 | 90 | 120 |
| 2 persons | 245 | 245 |
| 3 persons | 100 | 90 |
| 4 persons | 85 | 70 |
| 5 or more persons | 20 | 15 |

In order to understand the housing demand in the Town of Baie Ve rte, it is helpful to understand the household composition and associated housing needs. The 2016 Census provides information about the household types using census family information. A census family is defined as a married couple and the children, if any, of either and/or both spouses; a couple living common law and the children, if any, of either and/or both partners; or a lone parent of any marital status with at least one child living in the same dwelling and that child or those children. 

| Private households by household type | 2011 | 2016 |
|--|--|--|
| - One-census-family households | 435 | 415 | 
| -- Without children in a census family | 200 | 215 | 
| -- With children in a census family | 165 | 200 |
| - Multiple-census-family households | 20 | 0 | 
| - Non-census-family households | 105 | 125 |
| -- One-person households | 90 | 120 | 
| -- Two-or-more person non-census-family households | 10 | 10 |
| | Total private households | 540 |

� 23% of the households are not census families; 
� 77% are one-census family households and of these, 52% of the one-census families do not have children; 

From these statistics, it would appear that the Town of Baie Verte is a family-oriented community. The growing number of single person households could be attributed to the growing aging population rather than the 20-24-year-old age group which has remained stable during the same time period. Therefore, family-oriented services and amenities would need to be provided as well as services suitable for single seniors. 

The educational level in the community has improved as the percentage of individuals with higher education has doubled (see the Table below) and the percentage with no high school certificate, college diploma and university degree dropped from 36% to 14% of the total population. The level and type of education reflects the type of employment opportunities offered in the community. 

| Education Level | 2006 | 2016 |
|--|--|--|
|          Total population | 1060 | 695 |
| No certificate; diploma or degree | 385 | 95 |
| High school certificate or equivalent | 155 | 135 |
| Apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma | 215 | 110 |
| College; CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma | 185 | 235 |
| University certificate or diploma below the bachelor level | 25 | 10 |
| University certificate; diploma or degree | 100 | 110 |


## 2.2 The Economy, Labour and Income 
The Town's economy is dominated by the Rambler and Anaconda mining operations. Anaconda Mining Inc. constructed and is operating a marine dock and loading facility adjacent to its existing Pine Cove Gold Mine. The Point Rousse Port Facility is located on the Point Rousse Peninsula, along the northern portion of the Baie Verte Peninsula, approximately three kilometres northeast of Baie Ve rte. The project includes a new access road, a crusher and crushed rock stockpile laydown area, a conveyor loading system, shoreline and cribbed mooring bollards, rockfill approaches, and a temporary barge. 

The Town acts as a regional service centre for the top of the Baie Verte Peninsula. There are at least 10 communities on roads that must pass through the Town of Baie Verte with a 2016 population of 2,797 people who would likely seek services in the Town of Bay Verte before travelling the additional hour to Springdale or beyond. While both the population of Baie Verte and the outlying communities are declining, it should be noted that the Town of Baie Verte actually increased in population between 2006-2016. One question is whether there are seniors from the catchment area who are retiring into old age homes in Baie Verte? Are younger families from the region moving into Baie Verte for more programs and facilities for their children? Or are the two trends completely unrelated?

The following figure and table were developed by the Community Accounts, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador using Census Canada, 2016 statistics; it indicates a clear distinction 
in the types of employment and gender participation.

Census Canada provides a way to compare the income levels within a community by organizing income into ten equal categories or deciles. In Baie Verte, 50% of the population are in the bottom deciles {which helps to explain why 19% of households spend more than 30% of income on shelter) and 50% are in the top deciles. This is similar to the rest of the province.

From the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, Community Accounts website, the 
following information was excerpted. 
 
The 2017 self-reliance ratio for Baie Verte was 
78.9%. This is a measure of the community's dependency on government transfers such as: Canada Pension, Old Age Security, Employment Insurance, Income Support Assistance, etc. A higher self-reliance ratio indicates a lower dependency. The self-reliance ratio in the province was 79.9%

## 2.3 Housing

Not surprisingly, the dominant housing form is the single detached home, as shown on the table below.

**Occupied private dwellings by structure type of dwelling,2016** 

| | 2006 | 2016  |
|--|--|--|
| Total | 480 | 545  |

With regard to seniors housing, currently there are There are 2 seniors housing complexes: 
1. White Bay Retirement Living Complex (opened in 2019) 
2. Riverside Cottages (opened in 2017) 

## 3.0 Existing Land Use 
The original Town core was located west of Rattling Brook, behind the harbour front. As the need for more residential land grew, the area at the head of the bay was developed, called 'Newtown'. Ribbon development naturally happened along Route 410. 

The total size of the community is 390 km2; of this, about 2.5 km2 consists of the urban core (see map below). For this reason, the previous plan prepared in 1989 cautioned that, due to a lack of developable land, great care must be taken with all remaining usable land.

## 3.1

**Residential Land Use**

In the 1960's, Advocate Mines recognized the corporate advantages of creating a "nice" Town for their employees and thus was instrumental in providing both housing and recreation facilities. This involvement of the largest employer in the Town, coupled with the semi.insolation location, promoted the feeling of 'Community' and led to pride in the Town at that time. Residents had community amenities that were provided by the company and not by municipal government. This is no longer the case. 

The old Town is primarily Residential Medium Density (RMD) which takes in existing residential development and areas of infill opportunity. There are not many empty lots; however, some of these were turned into unorganized parking lots by the landowners. Also, infill development would not meet current RMD standards. The old town is surrounded by steep terrain that is not suitable for extending the RMD zone. 

There is a large area of land identified for RMD in the Newtown area, shown in the map below. However, there has been no development in the area to date and any future development should require a comprehensive plan to be submitted to ensure proper layout of roads 
and services. This area would be better to be identified as a Comprehensive Development Area.
Residential. Note that at the end of the road the Town will be developing a municipal facility.
 
The 'New Town' area has a Residential Low Density (RLD) area and homes have already been built into the adjacent Comprehensive Development Area. On Southshore Drive there is an established mobile home zone that is well-taken care of; however, there is limited opportunity 

The Comprehensive Development Area in 'New Town' neighbourhood. 
Note that residential development is also permitted in the Mixed Zone.

There are 2 Senior Citizens accommodation facilities: White Bay Retirement Living which is located in a Commercial General zone along the Provincial Highway Route 410 and Riverside Cottages for seniors which is also located in a Commercial General Zone (towards the college).

## 3.2 Employment-Generating Land Uses 

### 3.2.1 Commercial Land Use 

Currently there are two general locations identified for the 'Commercial General' zone, both sides of Route 410 and two sites within the 'New Town' neighbourhood. Both are not fully utilized. 

The other commercial zone is 'Downtown Commercial' located on a local road off Route 410 in the 'old town' neighbourhood (shown in red on the map below). A town park with a Memorial monument is at the heart of the area. This is landscaped with benches and a small walkway. In the winter, the Christmas parade also convenes at this location. During both Remembrance Day and Christmas events, residents either walk to the site or park in a communal parking area or in front of homes. The Town has not received any complaints regarding parking. 

One of the main commercial buildings is actually located by the waterfront in the 'Industrial and Marine Fishing' zone (shown in pink in the map below). The area is mostly built up but has potential vacant lands for future development as well as potential for streetscape beautification. Unfortunately, the best waterfront property is owned by Irving Oil. This land is under remediation. Until the remediation is completed, the site cannot be developed or used by the community as a public gathering space. 

### 3.2.2 Mixed Land Use

The 'Mixed Development' zone is located on a local road leading into the 'Downtown Commercial' zone and essentially represents an extension of that zone, but allows single dwelling residential use as well. The types of uses need to be reviewed, in particular, the 
residential density uses.

As well, this zone could be used in other locations within the community to allow for better use I of viewscapes or other geographic features. 

### 3.2.3 Tourism-oriented Land Use

The Town has only one tourism-related attraction, the Miner's Museum. There is a trail along the Conservation zone on the east side of Route 410 between the recreation facilities and the Rattling Brook park parking lot. There is a hike to a waterfall from this parking lot with views over the community and across the bay. 

Other initiatives include: 
� Bay Verte Marina Project (no Harbour Authority 
� Waterfront Beautification project (harbourfront) 
� Spruce Trail Cross-country Trails

### 3.2.4 Industrial Land Use 

Within the urban area of the Town, there is a Light Industrial zone applied to two locations which currently do not contain light 
industrial uses. Unlike many of the smaller surrounding communities, Baie Verte is not a fishery-based community. The Town has an 
active fish plant (owned by the Quinlan Brothers) and a Town marina (both located on Water Street). There are private wharves and stages scattered around the community.

The other industrial-type zone is 'Mineral Workings' which is applied to the former asbestos mine site and the Rambler site. 

## 3.3 Public/Institutional Land Use
 
The Town of Baie Verte has infrastructure and activities required for most every recreational activity, whether inside or out, winter or summer. Additionally, the town of Baie Ve rte holds an annual 3-day festival,' Spree by The Sea' to celebrate its civic holiday. This event is held on the 2nd weekend of August.

The map below shows the current 'Community and Social Services' (CSS) zoning for review. Some of the former public buildings will be re-purposed and zoning will be changed to facilitate these initiatives, for example, the empty school on High Street is proposed for the location of the new Community Centre; therefore, the public use and parking area requires appropriate zoning.

Other CSS locations identified in the past plan will be reviewed for future validity. As well, the uses permitted in the zone will be clarified. In some cases, it is not necessary to 'spot' zone for specific uses. For example, to accommodate a trend across the province, in other municipal plans, a church could be made a discretionary use in RMD and CG zones which would allow the denominations to re-purpose the building in the future without the cost of rezoning the property should this be necessary. 

## 3.4 Environmental Protection Land Uses 
The major environmental issue concerning the Town of Baie Verte is the protection of Southern Pond as a water supply source for future use. 

Currently it is in a 'Conservation' zone; however, it is proposed I that the designated area by zoned 'Watershed Protection' and that the land uses are subject to the Water Resource Management Division policies. 

Now that the water supply area is protected under the Water Resources Act, 1990, there remains the question regarding whether the previous 'Environmental Protection' zone is required for such a large area of the Town. 

Other 'Environmental Protection' designations occur along water bodies, the Baie Verte River and South River. 

Consideration should be given to defining this zone for protection of geophysical resources and habitat, as well as areas with geological hazards (steep slopes) or susceptible to climate change effects (flooding). 

The Open Space-Park-Recreation zone is applied throughout the community in a variety of ways. These locations need to be reviewed for current relevance and the use of this zone might be re-purposed to protect areas where natural areas need protection for recreational use focused on nature appreciation, such as trails, picnic areas, and viewscapes.

## 3.5 Rural Land Use 

The Rural zone encompasses the largest area of the Town and accommodates a range of natural resource uses, such as forestry and agriculture. The zone is also used for discretionary uses that are not compatible with the uses in the urban core. These will be reviewed to ensure that definitions are clear and as much as possible, the range of uses are appropriate for Baie Ve rte 
hinterland.

## 3.6 Provincial Land Uses and Regulations

The updated Municipal Plan and Development Regulations must reflect the land use designations and regulations of various provincial government agencies. At the time of the preparation of the Background Report, the comments from the Interdepartmental Land Use Committee had not been completed; however, the Land Use Atlas maintained by that department had been used to prepare the draft mapping showing updated locations for provincial concerns. 

##4.0 Public Services
 
## 4.1 Services

The Town is responsible for municipal services including 
� Fire Department 
� Water & Sewer 
� Garbage Collection 
� Snow Clearing 
� Library (Town provides space for free) 
� road maintenance 
� street lighting 

The provincial highway, Route 410 is the main road through the community and those 64 km are maintained by the provincial government. As provincial highways, a highway access permit is required. 

The modern growth era of Baie Verte began with the establishment of the asbestos mine (Advocate Mines) by Johns-Manville, in the early 1960's. Much of the Town's infrastructure, such as roads, and water and sewer systems, was constructed at that time. All buildings are fully serviced with water and sewer.

The local road network is maintained by Council, which consists of about 18 km of paved streets. Most local roads have pavement but hardly any sidewalks, some curbs and occasional ditches for drainage. The condition of the roads overall is poor. All roads have visible signage for public safety. The town is responsible for snow clearing. 

The volunteer fire Dept is very active and efforts to regionalize fire services with some neighbouring communities are currently underway.
 
## 4.2 Governance

Council is comprised of six Councilors and a Mayor. The Council holds regular monthly meetings and if situations dictate, more frequently. As well, Council can and may continue to hold special meetings and privileged meetings as situations may demand.

The Council operates within a set of Rules of Procedure to demonstrate order, sensibility and accountability at all meetings. Accountability for decisions is demonstrated in the Minutes of Meetings where all decisions of Council are documented using standard parliamentary procedures. 

The Councils' budget is prepared in accordance with the policy of the Provincial Government's Department of Municipal and Provincial Affairs. The preparatory work is completed by a Finance Committee and presented to Council, ratified by Council and submitted to the Department of Municipal and Provincial Affairs within the time lines established by the Municipalities Act, 1990. The budget normally receives tentative approval, final approval depending on receipt of the financial statements and audit reports for that previous budget year. 

The Council has the following Committees: 
� Recreation and Community Services 
� Finance and Policy 
� Planning and Development 
� Public Works 

The Town has a balanced budget of over $2M (2019) and a debt ratio of 6%.

Town staff include a Chief Administrative Officer, Financial Officer/Town Clerk, Superintendent 
of Public Works, a Financial Clerk and an Administrative Assistant plus outside municipal 
workers.
