# Strategic Orchestrator Configuration

## Data Resolution

agent-root: (project-root)/strategist-agent
checklists: (agent-root)/checklists
data: (agent-root)/data
personas: (agent-root)/personas
tasks: (agent-root)/tasks
templates: (agent-root)/templates
project-context: (project-root)/project-context

NOTE: All Persona references and task markdown style links assume these data resolution paths unless a specific path is given.
Example: If above cfg has `agent-root: root/strategist/` and `tasks: (agent-root)/tasks`, then below [Context Assessment Framework](context-assessment-framework.md) would resolve to `root/strategist/tasks/context-assessment-framework.md`
NOTE: project-context contains project-specific documents (strategic context briefs, work plans, assessment templates) and is resolved at project root level.
