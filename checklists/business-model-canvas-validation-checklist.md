**What This Looks Like:**
```
COHERENCE CHECK:

VALUE PROPOSITION: Easy-to-use integration platform
CUSTOMER SEGMENT: Enterprise companies
Question: Do enterprise customers value "easy to use"?
Answer: Yes, but only if feature-rich. Easy-to-use AND powerful
required for enterprise. Does our positioning deliver both?
Assessment: YES - we're "easy compared to custom" but also feature-rich

REVENUE MODEL: $50K annual subscription for enterprise
Question: Is this price aligned with value?
Analysis: Customer ROI = save $200K+ annually on developer time
Value = 4-10x cost. Price is aligned with value.
Assessment: YES - pricing is defensible

COST STRUCTURE: 20% on customer support for enterprise
Question: Can we support enterprise customers profitably?
Analysis: Enterprise customers need high-touch support.
Support cost may need to be 20-25% for enterprise.
At $50K revenue, that's $10K support cost = acceptable.
Assessment: YES - margins still healthy even with high support cost

RESOURCES/ACTIVITIES: 90+ pre-built integrations
Question: Do we have resources to maintain this?
Analysis: 10-person engineering team.
Maintaining 90 integrations = significant ongoing work.
Is this sustainable? Only if integrations are high-demand
and customer success shows value (justifying investment).
Assessment: OKAY - but need to monitor resource drain

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Model is internally coherent.
All pieces support each other. No major contradictions.
Model is viable if execution meets plan.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect alignment across all elements
- ❌ Detailed financial validation
- ❌ Complete capability assessment
- ❌ Perfect logic (some tension OK if understood)

---

### 3. Business Model Logic Is Explicit ✓

- [ ] **How do elements interact explained**
  - How does each element support others?
  - Where are dependencies?
  - What's the cause-and-effect?
  - Is logic clear?

- [ ] **Customer value creation is visible**
  - How do customers benefit?
  - How does each element contribute?
  - What's the path from activities to customer value?
  - Would customer understand logic?

- [ ] **Competitive positioning is clear**
  - How is our model different?
  - What's hard to copy?
  - What's our defensible advantage?
  - How do we stay ahead?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
BUSINESS MODEL LOGIC:

CUSTOMER VALUE CREATION:
1. We identify what integrations customer needs (customer research)
2. We pre-build those integrations (key activity)
3. We provide simple UI to configure them (key activity)
4. Customer can sync data in hours, not months (value delivered)
5. Customer saves $200K+ on developer time (value monetized)
6. Customer pays $30K for solution (our revenue)

ELEMENT INTERACTIONS:
Customer Segments → Value Prop → Revenue Model
Enterprise needs powerful + easy = $50K price
SMB needs simple + affordable = $1K price
(Same product, different positioning, different pricing)

Resources → Activities → Value Prop
90+ integrations (resource) + easy UI (activity) = less developer work
Engineering team (resource) + continuous improvement (activity) = platform reliability
Sales team (resource) + enterprise motion (activity) = customer acquisition

Partnerships → Customer Relationships
Cloud partners (partnerships) enable reliability (customer relationship)
Integration partners (partnerships) enable ecosystem (customer value)
Reseller partners (partnerships) reach new segments (channels)

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING:
Hard to copy: 90+ pre-built integrations (took years to build)
Our advantage: Network effect (more integrations = more valuable)
Market position: "Most integrations" = competitive moat
Long-term: As we add integrations, we become harder to beat

COST STRUCTURE enables business model:
To maintain 90 integrations and support enterprise
We need 30% of revenue in product/engineering
That leaves 40% gross margin for other costs
At scale, model is profitable (gross margin > operating costs)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect cause-and-effect
- ❌ Detailed interdependency maps
- ❌ Mathematical modeling
- ❌ Complete competitive analysis

---

### 4. Model Is Realistic and Achievable ✓

- [ ] **Elements are realistic**
  - Can we actually build this?
  - Do partnerships exist/are feasible?
  - Can we acquire/retain talent?
  - Is market response likely?

- [ ] **Unit economics work**
  - Gross margin is healthy?
  - CAC payback is reasonable?
  - LTV is attractive?
  - Model scales profitably?

- [ ] **Key assumptions identified**
  - What must be true for model to work?
  - What are risky assumptions?
  - What would break the model?
  - How would we validate?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
REALISM CHECK:

Can we build 90 integrations?
Assessment: Yes, and we have. This is proven.

Can we maintain them as platforms change?
Assessment: Yes, with dedicated team. This is built into cost model.

Will customers pay $30K for SMB offering?
Assessment: Moderate confidence. SMB is price sensitive.
We'd need to prove value = 10x cost. Possible but not certain.

Will enterprise partnerships work?
Assessment: Yes. We have some partners already.
Path is clear.

UNIT ECONOMICS:

Customer: Enterprise
Revenue: $30K annual
Gross margin: 70% ($21K)
CAC: $5K (assume 3-6 month payback; healthy for enterprise SaaS)
LTV: $100K+ (3+ year relationship; high margin = strong value)
LTV:CAC: 20:1 (excellent)

Assessment: Unit economics are strong for enterprise

Customer: SMB
Revenue: $2K annual
Gross margin: 60% ($1.2K) - lower because less economies of scale
CAC: $500 (need to be efficient; possibly channel-based)
LTV: $8K (4 year relationship; best case)
LTV:CAC: 16:1 (good, but tighter than enterprise)

Assessment: Unit economics are acceptable for SMB if CAC can be controlled

KEY ASSUMPTIONS:

Assumption 1: Enterprise willing to pay $30K for pre-built integrations
Why: Saves developer time ($200K+ annual value)
Risk: If value not realized, price pressure
Mitigation: Customer success ensures value realization

Assumption 2: SMB willing to pay $2K for simplified solution
Why: Easy to use + key integrations = value
Risk: If SMB market is too price-sensitive, won't work
Mitigation: Validate willingness to pay before heavy investment

Assumption 3: We can maintain 90 integrations efficiently
Why: Built cost into model (20% of revenue)
Risk: If maintenance costs higher, margins compress
Mitigation: Monitor actual vs. planned; reduce integrations if needed

Assumption 4: Customers stick around (low churn)
Why: Switching costs and value stickiness
Risk: If churn higher than modeled, LTV drops
Mitigation: Monitor churn; improve customer success if needed
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect achievability assessment
- ❌ Complete market validation
- ❌ Detailed financial models
- ❌ Risk-free assumptions

### 5. Model Evolves Based on Market Learning ✓

- [ ] **Adaptation strategy is clear**
  - How will we know if model working?
  - When would we pivot?
  - What's the learning approach?
  - How do we stay flexible?

- [ ] **Contingencies identified**
  - If assumption 1 breaks, what do we do?
  - If assumption 2 breaks, what do we do?
  - Are there fallback positions?
  - Can we adjust model mid-course?

- [ ] **Scalability path is visible**
  - How does model scale with revenue?
  - Do unit economics improve at scale?
  - Are there scalability challenges?
  - How do we plan for scaling?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
EVOLUTION & LEARNING:

Measurement Approach:
Monthly: Track unit economics by customer segment
- CAC actual vs. plan
- LTV actual vs. plan
- Churn rate (overall and by segment)
- Customer satisfaction

Quarterly: Assess model assumptions
- Are customer segments behaving as expected?
- Is pricing right?
- Are partnerships working?
- Are activities supporting value prop?

Pivot Triggers:
IF SMB adoption is 50%+ slower than plan
AND financial projections miss by 25%+
THEN reassess SMB strategy (continue, pivot, or stop)

IF Enterprise churn rises above 10% (vs. 5% planned)
THEN investigate (product? support? competition?)
and adjust business model if needed

ADAPTATION OPTIONS:

If SMB market is less receptive than expected:
- Adjust pricing (lower to increase adoption)
- Simplify feature set further (reduce cost)
- Refocus on enterprise (proven segment)
- Pivot to adjacent segment (mid-market)

If integration maintenance is more expensive:
- Build API platform (let partners build integrations)
- Reduce number of integrations (focus on key ones)
- Adopt third-party integration marketplace
- Increase customer success cost and prices

SCALABILITY:

Current model (100 customers, $2M revenue):
- 30 engineers for product/integrations
- 10 customer success team
- 15 sales/marketing
- Gross margin: 65-70%
- Operating margin: Break-even to slight positive

Scaled model (1000 customers, $30M revenue):
- 50 engineers (not 300) due to automation/leverage
- 50 customer success (not 100) due to self-serve
- 50 sales/marketing (not 150) due to efficiency
- Gross margin: 70-75% (improve through scale)
- Operating margin: 30%+ (profitable at scale)

Assessment: Model scales well. Margins improve.
Not capital-intensive. Good unit economics at scale.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect contingency plans
- ❌ Detailed learning metrics
- ❌ Complete scalability modeling
- ❌ Predictive accuracy
