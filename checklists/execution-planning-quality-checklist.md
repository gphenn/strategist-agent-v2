### 5. Plan Identifies & Addresses Key Risks ✓

- [ ] **Major risks are identified**
  - What could derail execution?
  - What's the biggest risk?
  - What external factors could impact?
  - Are obvious risks included?

- [ ] **Risk mitigation is outlined**
  - How would we prevent key risks?
  - How would we detect early?
  - How would we respond?
  - Is mitigation realistic?

- [ ] **Contingency plans exist**
  - If timeline slips, what do we do?
  - If customer adoption slower, what do we do?
  - If team member leaves, what do we do?
  - Are alternatives identified?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
RISK MANAGEMENT:

Risk 1: Product Development Timeline Slips

Risk: Development takes longer than 6 months

Mitigation:
- Hire experienced VP Product (knows how to execute fast)
- Reduce scope to must-haves only
- Weekly milestone tracking
- Resource contingency built in

Detection:
- Monthly milestone reviews (Is product on track?)
- If 2+ weeks behind, escalate
- Trigger: Month 4 milestone slipped

Response:
- Reduce scope further (cut lower-priority features)
- Add resources if available
- Delay launch 2-4 weeks (manage expectations)
- Descope 2-3 features to stay close to timeline

Residual risk: Acceptable (could live with Month 8 launch)

---

Risk 2: Pilot Customers Don't Adopt/Churn

Risk: Pilots show low satisfaction (NPS <40) or churn

Mitigation:
- Carefully select pilot customers (strong fit)
- Dedicated support during pilot
- Weekly check-ins with pilots
- Rapid iteration based on feedback

Detection:
- Monthly pilot satisfaction tracking
- NPS target Month 8: 50+
- If NPS <40, pause additional pilots

Response:
- Pause new customer acquisitions
- Focus on pilot customer success
- Product refinement based on feedback
- 4-week re-engagement effort
- If still <40 NPS after refinement, reconsider market fit

Residual risk: Acceptable (market could be wrong; would pivot)

---

Risk 3: Key Talent Leaves

Risk: VP Product or key engineer departs mid-project

Mitigation:
- Competitive compensation (top-of-market pay)
- Clear equity/incentives for retention
- Strong vision/mission (people motivated)
- Succession plan in place

Detection:
- Regular 1:1s with key people
- Manager check-ins on engagement
- Pulse surveys quarterly

Response:
- Emergency backfill (recruitment)
- Interim coverage (other team members)
- Compressed timeline (if necessary)
- Scope adjustment (if necessary)

Residual risk: Manageable (could impact timeline; not fatal)

---

Risk 4: Faster Competitor Response

Risk: Competitor launches SMB product Month 8 (before us)

Mitigation:
- Move fast (hit Month 10 launch target)
- Differentiate via vertical expertise
- Build customer relationships early (pilots become advocates)
- Lock in early customers (incentivize commitment)

Detection:
- Weekly competitive intelligence
- If competitor announces, assess threat
- Re-evaluate positioning if needed

Response:
- Accelerate differentiation (enhance vertical focus)
- Emphasize customer success (switching cost)
- Consider partnership/acquisition (if strategic fit)

Residual risk: Acceptable (18-month lead is still defensible)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Exhaustive risk list
- ❌ Perfect risk mitigation
- ❌ Zero contingency
- ❌ Risk-free execution

   - Would success achieve the outcome?

4. **Are we ready to execute?**
   - Are resources committed?
   - Is budget approved?
   - Is team in place?
   - Are we ready to start?

---

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Plan is Ready When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Clear objectives and success criteria

### 🔄 Plan Needs More Work When

- **Ownership missing?** → Assign clear owners
- **Budget unclear?** → Estimate resources; allocate budget
- **Risks ignored?** → Identify and plan mitigation
- **No governance?** → Define decision and communication process

---
