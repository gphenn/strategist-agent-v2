**What This Looks Like:**

```
FINANCIAL MODELING:

Innovation: Outcome-Based Pricing

Revenue Scenario:
Base case: 30% of customers adopt outcome-based (highest impact)
- These customers: Average $500K savings
- Fee: 20% of savings = $100K per customer
- Traditional customers: $50K ACV
- Blended revenue: Slightly higher than current

Profitability Timeline:
Year 1: Revenue flat; cost up (new billing system)
  → EBITDA negative 5%

Year 2: 30% adoption; revenue up 15%; cost normalized
  → EBITDA improves to +12%

Year 3: 50% adoption; strong retention; revenue up 30%
  → EBITDA improves to +20%

Investment: $500K systems + transition
Payback: Year 2 (systems paid back; profitability improved)

---

Innovation: Platform Ecosystem Model

Revenue Scenario:
Year 1: Platform development; no ecosystem revenue
Year 2: 10 partners; $50K average revenue each = $500K platform revenue
Year 3: 30 partners; $100K average; platform revenue $3M
Year 5: 100 partners; $500K average; platform revenue $50M

Profitability Impact:
Year 1-2: Negative (major platform investment)
Year 3: Break-even on platform (development costs recovered)
Year 4+: Positive (ecosystem scales; cost stable)

Platform profitability:
Year 3: $3M revenue - $2M costs = $1M profit
Year 5: $50M revenue - $10M costs = $40M profit

Full company impact:
Year 1: Negative (platform investment)
Year 2: Slight negative (ecosystem building)
Year 3-5: Positive (accelerating)

Investment: $2-3M in platform development
Timeline: 24+ months to break-even
Risk: Ecosystem may not develop as planned

---

Innovation: Vertical SaaS Model

Revenue Scenario:
Year 1: Automotive product launched; 10 automotive customers at $80K
  → Automotive revenue: $800K
  → Total company revenue: $2.8M (adds to existing horizontal)

Year 2: 25 automotive customers; add pharma vertical (15 customers at $80K)
  → Automotive + pharma revenue: $3.2M
  → Total company revenue: $5.2M (20% higher)

Year 3: 40 automotive; 25 pharma; add food processing (15 customers)
  → Vertical revenue: $4.4M
  → Total company revenue: $6.8M (30% higher)

Profitability Impact:
Year 1: Investment in vertical (negative near-term)
  → Company EBITDA: -$200K (investment in automotive)

Year 2: Vertical grows; profitability returns
  → Company EBITDA: +$500K (vertical scale)

Year 3: Multiple verticals; strong profitability
  → Company EBITDA: +$1.2M (compound growth)

Investment: $300K to launch automotive vertical
Timeline: 12 months to profitability impact
Risk: Lower (proven SaaS model; shorter timeline)
