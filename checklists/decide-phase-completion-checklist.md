# DECIDE Phase Completion Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that the DECIDE phase (Strategic Advisor) has completed all essential work before transitioning to the ACT phase. This checklist ensures strategic options have been thoroughly evaluated, trade-offs are understood, and a clear path forward has been established with defined success metrics.

## What This Phase Accomplishes

The DECIDE phase transforms strategic insights and narrative into actionable decisions. The Strategic Advisor ensures:
- Strategic options are clearly defined and evaluated
- Trade-offs are explicitly analyzed
- Risks are assessed and understood
- Recommendations are clear and justified
- Implementation foundation is established

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Strategic Options Fully Defined ✓

- [ ] **All viable options identified**
  - Main strategic options articulated (minimum 2, ideally 3)
  - Each option is substantively different (not minor variations)
  - Options cover main strategic choices (not implementation variations)
  - "Do nothing" option explicitly considered

- [ ] **Each option is fully described**
  - What does this option entail? (Clear, specific)
  - Why is this option viable? (Grounded in findings)
  - What would need to happen for this option? (Prerequisites, timing, resources)
  - What does success look like for this option? (Metrics and targets)

- [ ] **Mutually exclusive nature understood**
  - Can we do multiple options simultaneously? (Clarify if yes/no)
  - If exclusive, implications of not choosing option explained
  - If combinations possible, what are they?
  - Timeline for decision (can we revisit later?)

**What This Looks Like:**

**Option 1: Enterprise-Only Focus (Status Quo+)**
- Continue focused on enterprise segment
- Strengthen competitive position through advanced features
- Accept SMB segment loss as competitive cost
- Requires: Enhanced product roadmap, sales focus on enterprise, accept 10-15% churn
- Success: Enterprise ARR $25M by year 3, NPS >80, >90% retention

**Option 2: Dual-Segment Strategy**
- Create separate SMB offering with simplified feature set
- Maintain enterprise excellence
- Capture SMB growth opportunity
- Requires: Parallel product roadmap, dual go-to-market, separate org structure
- Success: Enterprise $25M + SMB $15M by year 3; retention >85% both segments

**Option 3: Acquire SMB Competitor**
- Purchase existing SMB solution
- Integrate into portfolio
- Leverage combined customer base
- Requires: $50M investment, integration team, 12-month timeline
- Success: Combined entity $30M by year 3; cost synergies realized

**Option 4: Do Nothing/Revisit Later**
- Continue current strategy
- Evaluate market conditions in 6-12 months
- Requires: Accept continued churn; monitor competitive moves
- Success: No decision is needed now; revisit timing is clear

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect options (good enough is fine)
- ❌ Exhaustive list (main viable options sufficient)
- ❌ Complete option specifications (framework sufficient)
- ❌ Unanimous agreement that options are right ones

---

### 2. Trade-Off Analysis Completed ✓

- [ ] **For each option, trade-offs articulated**
  - What do we gain with this option?
  - What do we give up with this option?
  - Time-based trade-offs (quick wins vs. long-term value)
  - Resource-based trade-offs (investment required, opportunity cost)
  - Risk-based trade-offs (stability vs. opportunity)

- [ ] **Trade-offs compared across options**
  - Option 1 vs. Option 2: What's the difference?
  - Where do options have similar trade-offs?
  - Which option requires most investment?
  - Which option has most risk? Most upside?
  - Is there a trade-off hierarchy (what matters most)?

- [ ] **Strategic priorities inform trade-off assessment**
  - Does organization prioritize profitability or growth?
  - What's appetite for risk/innovation?
  - What timeline matters (short vs. long term)?
  - What's acceptable level of organizational disruption?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
TRADE-OFF MATRIX:

Option 1: Enterprise-Only
Gain: Simplicity, maximize enterprise profitability, lower risk
Give Up: $500M market opportunity, future competitiveness in SMB

Option 2: Dual-Segment
Gain: Capture large market opportunity, future growth, market leadership
Give Up: Profitability (near term), organizational simplicity, R&D complexity

Option 3: Acquire
Gain: Fast entry, built-in SMB product, immediate revenue
Give Up: $50M cash, integration risk, management distraction

TRADE-OFF ASSESSMENT:
If we prioritize: Near-term profit → Option 1 wins
If we prioritize: Long-term market share → Option 2 wins
If we prioritize: Speed to market → Option 3 wins
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Quantified trade-offs (relative assessment sufficient)
- ❌ Perfect clarity on all trade-offs
- ❌ Consensus on which trade-offs matter most
- ❌ Final decision (just clear articulation)

  - Strategic risks (market, competitive, execution)
  - Financial risks (investment, ROI)
  - Organizational risks (capability, distraction, culture)
  - Customer risks (satisfaction, retention, churn)
  - Timing risks (market window closing, competitor moves)

- [ ] **Risk probability and impact assessed**
  - Which risks are most likely to occur?
  - Which risks would have biggest negative impact if they occur?
  - High probability + high impact = critical risks
  - Risk ranking established

- [ ] **Mitigation approaches outlined**
  - For critical risks: How would we prevent or mitigate?
  - Mitigation feasibility assessed
  - Mitigation cost considered
  - Residual risk after mitigation understood

- [ ] **Risk monitoring approach suggested**
  - What indicators would signal risk is materializing?
  - How frequently should we monitor?
  - What's the trigger for course correction?
  - Who owns risk monitoring?

**What This Looks Like:**

**Option 2: Dual-Segment Strategy**

**Critical Risks:**
- Risk 1: R&D splits focus; neither product gets best talent
  - Probability: HIGH | Impact: HIGH
  - Mitigation: Establish separate product teams; clear prioritization
  - Residual Risk: MEDIUM (can't completely eliminate)

- Risk 2: SMB sales channel unfamiliar territory; slow ramp
  - Probability: MEDIUM | Impact: MEDIUM
  - Mitigation: Hire experienced SMB sales leader; use partners
  - Residual Risk: MEDIUM

- Risk 3: Competitor launches SMB offering before us
  - Probability: MEDIUM | Impact: HIGH
  - Mitigation: Accelerate timeline; differentiate clearly
  - Residual Risk: MEDIUM

**Monitoring:**
- Quarterly: Competitive landscape review
- Monthly: Product team capacity metrics
- Weekly: Sales pipeline progress
- Trigger: If competitor SMB product found, escalate to executive

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Comprehensive risk register
- ❌ Quantified probabilities
- ❌ Detailed mitigation plans
- ❌ Risk-free options (all have risk)
