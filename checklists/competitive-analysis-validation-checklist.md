- Opportunity: Simplify UX without losing power

OPPORTUNITY IMPLICATIONS:

Opportunity A: Serve SMB with simplified offering
- Requires: New product, separate team, different GTM

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Analysis is Ready When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Competitors are identified and scoped
- Feature comparison is clear
- Competitive positioning is understood
- Threats and vulnerabilities are identified
- Market gaps and opportunities are clear
- Data sources are documented
- Organization and clarity are good

**Analysis can inform competitive strategy.**

---

### 🔄 Analysis Needs More Work When

- **Competitors unclear?** → Identify who really competes for our customers
- **Features not compared?** → Create clear feature matrix
- **Positioning vague?** → Define how each competitor is positioned
- **Threats not identified?** → What would harm us most?
- **Opportunities missing?** → What could we do differently?
- **Confidence too low?** → Improve data gathering or acknowledge gaps

---

## What This Validates

✅ Competitive landscape is clear
✅ Our competitive position is understood
✅ Threats are identified
✅ Opportunities are visible
✅ Analysis informs strategy

## Common Issues & Resolution

| Issue | Signal | Resolution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Too many competitors** | "15 competitors listed" | Focus on 3-5 direct; others are indirect |
| **Features not comparable** | "Can't tell who wins" | Create matrix; use common criteria |
| **Positioning unclear** | "I don't know where we stand" | Define each competitor's positioning clearly |
| **Threats missing** | "What should worry us?" | Ask what would hurt us most |
| **Opportunities vague** | "Where's the upside?" | Identify market gaps we could fill |
| **Data too old** | "From 2023" | Update with current information |
