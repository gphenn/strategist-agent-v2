# Strategic Decision Matrix Validation Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that a completed Strategic Decision Matrix provides a rigorous framework for evaluating strategic options with clear criteria, transparent scoring, and defensible recommendations.

## What Gets Validated

**Template Reference:** `templates/strategic-decision-matrix.md`

**Used In:** DECIDE phase for systematic option evaluation

**Audience:** Executives, decision-makers evaluating strategic alternatives

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Decision Question is Clear ✓

- [ ] **Decision being made is explicit**
  - What exactly are we deciding?
  - Is decision clearly stated?
  - Is decision specific (not vague)?
  - Would different people understand same decision?

- [ ] **Context for decision provided**
  - Why is this decision needed now?
  - What prompted the decision?
  - What's at stake?
  - What's the timeline?

- [ ] **Decision authority clear**
  - Who will make final decision?
  - When will decision be made?
  - What input is needed?
  - What happens after decision?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
DECISION BEING MADE:
"Should we enter the SMB market segment, and if so, how?"

CONTEXT:
- Current state: Enterprise-focused, highly profitable
- Problem: SMB segment is large ($2B) and growing; competitors
  moving downmarket; our SMB customers churning at 15%
- Opportunity: Could serve both enterprise and SMB profitably
- Timing: Market window for SMB entry is 12-18 months before
  competitors consolidate market
- Risk: Dual focus could distract from enterprise excellence

DECISION AUTHORITY:
- Decision-maker: CEO (with Board input)
- Timeline: This month
- Input needed: Executive leadership perspectives; Board guidance
- Next step: If approved, detailed execution planning
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Complete context (summary sufficient)
- ❌ Detailed decision tree
- ❌ Complete stakeholder input

---

### 2. Strategic Options are Distinct & Complete ✓

- [ ] **All viable options identified**
  - What are real strategic choices?
  - Are options meaningfully different?
  - Is "do nothing" option included?
  - Are there any other viable paths?

- [ ] **Options are clearly described**
  - What specifically would each option mean?
  - What would be required to execute?
  - What would success look like for each?
  - Are implications of each clear?

- [ ] **Options are mutually exclusive or combinations identified**
  - Can we do multiple options? (If yes, note combinations)
  - If mutually exclusive, are trade-offs clear?
  - Is timing of decision right? (Can we revisit later?)

**What This Looks Like:**
```
OPTION 1: DO NOTHING / ENTERPRISE-ONLY FOCUS
What it means: Continue current enterprise-only strategy
Requirements: Maintain current product, sales, marketing focus
Success looks like: Enterprise grows to $25M ARR; maintain >90% retention
Implications: Miss $2B market opportunity; competitors establish SMB dominance

OPTION 2: DUAL-SEGMENT STRATEGY (Recommended)
What it means: Create separate SMB offering while maintaining enterprise excellence
Requirements: New product team, separate GTM, $5M investment, 18-month timeline
Success looks like: Enterprise $25M + SMB $10M by Year 2
Implications: More complex organization, split resources, greater growth potential

OPTION 3: ACQUIRE SMB COMPETITOR
What it means: Purchase existing SMB solution; integrate into portfolio
Requirements: $50M acquisition, integration team, 12-month integration
Success looks like: Combined entity $30M by Year 2; cost synergies realized
Implications: High cash outlay, integration complexity, faster entry

COMBINATIONS:
- Option 2 + 3: Acquire to accelerate SMB entry while building separate product
  (Could work but most expensive)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Every possible option
- ❌ Detailed business plans for each
- ❌ Complete specifications
- ❌ Exhaustive implications

---

### 3. Decision Criteria are Relevant & Weighted ✓

- [ ] **Criteria reflect what matters**
  - What factors should inform this decision?
  - Are criteria aligned with company strategy?
  - Would executives agree these are right criteria?
  - Are all important factors covered?

- [ ] **Criteria are weighted appropriately**
  - Does weight reflect importance?
  - Are weights explicit (not just implicit)?
  - Would decision-makers agree with weights?
  - Do weights total to 100%?

- [ ] **Criteria are measurable or assessable**
  - Can we evaluate each option on each criterion?
  - Are criteria vague or specific?
  - Would different people score options similarly?
  - Can we defend scoring?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
STRATEGIC CRITERIA & WEIGHTS:

1. MARKET OPPORTUNITY (Weight: 30%) — How much growth potential?
   Definition: TAM size, growth rate, competitive window

2. FINANCIAL RETURNS (Weight: 25%) — Is ROI attractive?
   Definition: Investment required, revenue potential, profitability timeline

3. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING (Weight: 25%) — Improves competitive position?
   Definition: Defensible advantage, market leadership, moat strength

4. ORGANIZATIONAL FEASIBILITY (Weight: 20%) — Can we execute?
   Definition: Resource availability, capability gaps, execution risk

TOTAL WEIGHTS: 30% + 25% + 25% + 20% = 100% ✓

WEIGHTING RATIONALE:
- Market opportunity weighted highest because market entry window
  is time-limited; competitive dynamics changing fast
- Financial returns weighted highly because we're profitable
  company; can't justify massive investment
- Competitive positioning matters because we want defensible
  advantage, not temporary market share gain
- Organizational feasibility important but acknowledged: we can
  build capability; execution is more flexible than market timing
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect criteria
- ❌ Unanimous agreement on weights
- ❌ Quantified measurement
- ❌ Complex weighting schemes

---

### 4. Options Evaluated Against Criteria ✓

- [ ] **Each option scored on each criterion**
  - Is scoring clear and transparent?
  - Can we see how options compare?
  - Is scoring methodology explained?
  - Would someone understand the scoring?

- [ ] **Scoring is consistent**
  - Are scores on same scale?
  - Is scoring logic consistent across options?
  - Could someone else score options the same way?
  - Any outlier scores explained?

- [ ] **Supporting rationale provided**
  - Why did we score each option that way?
  - What evidence supports each score?
  - What trade-offs exist?
  - Are any scores uncertain?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
DECISION MATRIX:

CRITERION                | Option 1    | Option 2    | Option 3
                        | (Do Nothing) | (Dual-Seg)  | (Acquire)
Market Opportunity      | 2/10        | 9/10        | 7/10
  (Weight: 30%)         | Limited to  | Captures    | Gains SMB
                        | enterprise  | $2B market  | access but
                        | growth      |             | limited upside

Financial Returns       | 8/10        | 8/10        | 6/10
  (Weight: 25%)         | High margin | Balanced    | High investment,
                        | but limited | growth/     | uncertain
                        | growth      | margin      | integration costs

Competitive Positioning | 5/10        | 9/10        | 7/10
  (Weight: 25%)         | Vulnerable  | Market      | Established SMB
                        | to downmkt  | leadership  | but integration
                        | moves       | position    | challenges

Org Feasibility         | 9/10        | 6/10        | 5/10
  (Weight: 20%)         | No change;  | Dual focus; | High complexity;
                        | simple      | some risk   | major integration

WEIGHTED SCORES:
Option 1: (2×0.30) + (8×0.25) + (5×0.25) + (9×0.20) = 0.6 + 2.0 + 1.25 + 1.8 = 5.65/10
Option 2: (9×0.30) + (8×0.25) + (9×0.25) + (6×0.20) = 2.7 + 2.0 + 2.25 + 1.2 = 8.15/10 ← HIGHEST
Option 3: (7×0.30) + (6×0.25) + (7×0.25) + (5×0.20) = 2.1 + 1.5 + 1.75 + 1.0 = 6.35/10
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Quantified objective scoring
- ❌ Perfect consistency
- ❌ Unanimous agreement on scores
- ❌ Complex statistical analysis

---

### 5. Trade-Offs Are Explicitly Addressed ✓

- [ ] **Trade-offs are stated clearly**
  - What do we gain with each option?
  - What do we give up?
  - What's the key trade-off?
  - Is there a clear winner or do trade-offs matter?

- [ ] **Strategic choices are visible**
  - Is there a fundamental choice being made?
  - Would different stakeholders weight criteria differently?
  - Are there legitimate alternative views?
  - What would change someone's mind about this?

- [ ] **Sensitivity analysis considered**
  - Would changing weights change outcome?
  - How sensitive is recommendation to key assumptions?
  - What would we need to be wrong about?
  - How confident are we in recommendation?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
KEY TRADE-OFFS:

Trade-off 1: Growth vs. Simplicity
- Option 2 wins on growth opportunity (9 vs. 2)
- Option 1 wins on organizational simplicity (9 vs. 6)
- Choice: Do we prioritize market opportunity or simplicity?
- Implication: If we choose Option 2, we accept complexity

Trade-off 2: Speed vs. Certainty
- Option 3 fastest to market (acquisition)
- Option 2 takes longer but more certainty (organic build)
- Choice: Do we value speed or control?
- Implication: If we choose Option 3, we accept integration risk

Trade-off 3: Capital vs. Upside
- Option 3 requires $50M; Option 2 requires $5M
- Option 3 faster returns; Option 2 longer payback
- Choice: How much capital can we deploy? How much risk?
- Implication: If we choose Option 3, large capital outlay

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:

"What if market opportunity is smaller than estimated?"
- If SMB market is $1B (vs. $2B), Option 2 score drops to 7.5/10
- Still wins vs. Option 1 (5.65) but closer to Option 3 (6.35)
- Conclusion: Even with downside, Option 2 wins

"What if we can't execute dual focus?"
- If organizational feasibility for Option 2 drops to 4/10
- Option 2 score drops to 7.25/10; still wins
- But risk is real; need strong governance

"What if competition moves faster?"
- If we lose first-mover advantage in SMB (Option 2 drops to 7/10)
- Option 2 still wins but margin tightens
- Timing is critical; can't wait
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Exhaustive sensitivity analysis
- ❌ Statistical confidence intervals
- ❌ Perfect quantification
- ❌ Complete uncertainty assessment

---

### 6. Recommendation is Clear & Justified ✓

- [ ] **Clear recommendation from matrix**
  - Which option is recommended?
  - Why this option? (Clear rationale from matrix)
  - What's the confidence level?
  - What could change recommendation?

- [ ] **Recommendation is defensible**
  - Would someone understand why?
  - Is logic sound?
  - Are alternatives acknowledged?
  - What would we need to be wrong about?

- [ ] **Next steps are clear**
  - If recommendation approved, what happens next?
  - Who decides?
  - When is decision finalized?
  - What work begins?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
RECOMMENDATION:
Option 2 - Dual-Segment Strategy is recommended.

RATIONALE:
Based on decision matrix, Option 2 scores 8.15/10 vs. 5.65 for Option 1
and 6.35 for Option 3. Primary reasons:
1. Captures substantial market opportunity (9/10 vs. 2/10 and 7/10)
2. Maintains financial attractiveness (8/10 across options)
3. Provides defensible competitive positioning (9/10)
4. While complex organizationally, risk is manageable with good governance

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH
- Market opportunity is well-researched and validated
- Financial case is solid across scenarios
- Organizational complexity is real but manageable
- Competitive timing is critical but window still open

WHAT WOULD CHANGE RECOMMENDATION:
- If we lose top SMB sales talent (makes Option 1 more attractive)
- If major enterprise customer signals concern about focus (Option 1)
- If we can't raise capital for investment (Option 1)
- If competitor moves extremely fast (might suggest Option 3 speed)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Executive decision on recommendation (this month)
2. If approved: Detailed execution planning for dual-segment strategy
3. Monthly governance review of progress
4. Gate review at 6 months to assess execution and adjust if needed
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect certainty
- ❌ Unanimous stakeholder agreement
- ❌ Exhaustive contingency plans
- ❌ Complete implementation details

## Quality Checks (Before Approving)

Before confirming matrix is complete, ask yourself:

1. **Would decision-maker understand this?**
   - Can they see the options clearly?
   - Do they understand the criteria?
   - Can they see why recommendation emerges?
   - Would they have questions?

2. **Is recommendation defensible?**
   - Does it follow logically from matrix?
   - Would someone challenge the recommendation?
   - How would you respond to challenges?
   - Are trade-offs clear?

3. **Are all important factors considered?**
   - Are there criteria that should be included?
   - Are weighting realistic?
   - Would decision-makers agree with criteria?
   - Is anything missing?

4. **Could someone else score differently?**
   - Is scoring methodology clear?
   - Would scoring be similar?
   - Any subjective judgments?
   - How confident are we in scoring?

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Matrix is Ready When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Decision question is clear
- Strategic options are distinct and complete
- Decision criteria are relevant and weighted
- Options are evaluated against criteria
- Trade-offs are explicitly addressed
- Recommendation is clear and justified
- Documentation quality is good

**Matrix can guide strategic decision-making.**

---

### 🔄 Matrix Needs More Work When

- **Decision unclear?** → Clarify exactly what's being decided
- **Options not distinct?** → Define truly different strategic paths
- **Criteria weak?** → Ensure criteria align with what matters
- **Scoring inconsistent?** → Clarify methodology; apply consistently
- **Trade-offs invisible?** → Make explicit what we gain/lose
- **Recommendation unclear?** → Show clearly which option wins and why

---

## Common Issues & Resolution

| Issue | Signal | Resolution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Too many criteria** | "8 criteria to evaluate" | Consolidate to 4-6 key ones |
| **Criteria too vague** | "Can't score this" | Define specifically how to measure |
| **Scoring all similar** | "Everything scores 5-6" | Sharpen differentiation between options |
| **Matrix doesn't match recommendation** | "You said A but matrix shows B" | Fix scoring or rationale |
| **Weights seem arbitrary** | "Why is this 30%?" | Explain weighting rationale |
| **Missing obvious option** | "What about doing both?" | Add combination options |

---
