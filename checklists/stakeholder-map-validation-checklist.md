### 5. Alignment Gaps & Conflicts Identified ✓

- [ ] **Stakeholder conflicts surfaced**

**What This Looks Like:**
```
STAKEHOLDER CONFLICTS:

Conflict 1: Enterprise vs. SMB Focus

VP Product wants: Continue enterprise-only focus
VP Sales wants: Pursue SMB opportunity immediately
CEO wants: Data-driven decision with clear execution plan
CFO wants: Strategy that maximizes ROI

Gap: Different views on market opportunity and execution capability

Resolution approach:
- Present data on both markets
- Show execution plan addresses resource concerns
- Propose separate teams (addresses focus concern)
- Model financials for both scenarios
- Empower CEO to make decision with full information

---

Conflict 2: Speed vs. Caution

VP Sales wants: Launch SMB product ASAP (fear of competition)
VP Product wants: Careful, deliberate approach (quality concern)
CEO wants: Fast enough to capture opportunity, slow enough to get right

Gap: Different risk tolerance and time horizons

Resolution approach:
- Acknowledge both concerns are valid
- Define phased approach (MVP launch in 6 months, scale from there)
- Build in quality gates but maintain aggressive timeline
- Regular reviews to assess execution quality

---

MISALIGNMENT RISKS:

Risk 1: Sales team assumes SMB launch will be quick
- Reality: Product development takes 6+ months
- Mitigation: Set expectations early; show timeline; manage surprises

Risk 2: Enterprise customers fear company will abandon enterprise
- Reality: Enterprise is core but we're also pursuing SMB
- Mitigation: Clear messaging that enterprise remains priority

Risk 3: VP Product assumes SMB will distract from enterprise
- Reality: Separate teams and roadmaps can prevent distraction
- Mitigation: Clear organizational structure and resource allocation

## Quality Checks

Before confirming map is complete, ask yourself:

1. **Would this identify problems early?**
   - Would we catch blocker/resister?
   - Would we understand resistance?
   - Would engagement strategy address it?
   - Would we have time to respond?

2. **Is stakeholder assessment credible?**
   - Based on real conversation or assumption?
   - Would stakeholders recognize their positions?
   - Are concerns fairly represented?
   - Is there bias in assessment?

3. **Is engagement strategy realistic?**
   - Can we actually engage this way?
   - Do we have time/resources?
   - Are approaches appropriate?
   - Would they actually move stakeholders?

4. **Would this support alignment?**
   - Does it show where consensus exists?
   - Does it identify conflicts?
   - Does strategy address conflicts?
   - Would execution follow this plan?

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Map is Ready When

All blocking criteria are met:

- Organization and documentation are good

**Map can guide stakeholder alignment efforts.**

## Common Issues & Resolution

| Issue | Signal | Resolution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Too many stakeholders** | "50 people listed" | Focus on key influencers; group others |
| **Positions unclear** | "Don't know if they support" | Assess based on prior interactions or ask directly |
| **No engagement plan** | "How do we engage them?" | Define specific information needs and approaches |
| **Conflicts missing** | "This seems unanimous" | Look deeper; identify hidden concerns |
| **Influence underestimated** | "Surprise opposition later" | Identify all people who can influence decision |
| **Too theoretical** | "Doesn't feel practical" | Ground in real stakeholder dynamics |
