- [ ] User can describe the impact or importance
- [ ] Challenge is clear enough for strategic work to begin

**NOT Required:**

- Root cause analysis
- Quantified impact metrics
- Complete problem decomposition

### 3. Stakeholder Understanding ‚úì

**Question:** "Do we know who's involved and affected?"

- [ ] User knows who the key decision makers are

- [ ] Outcomes are clear enough to guide strategic work

**NOT Required:**

- Precise success metrics
- Detailed measurement frameworks
- Complete outcome specifications

## Overall Readiness Assessment

### ‚úÖ Ready to Proceed When

All four dimensions have basic clarity:

- User can describe their context (doesn't need to be complete)
- User can explain their challenge (doesn't need to be quantified)  
- User knows key stakeholders (doesn't need full mapping)
- User has outcome vision (doesn't need precise metrics)

### üîÑ Continue Discovery When

Major gaps exist in understanding:

- User unclear about basic business context
- User can't explain why challenge matters
- User doesn't know who's involved
- User has no sense of desired outcomes

### üë§ User Signals Override Assessment

Always respect user readiness signals:

- **"I think we have enough to get started"** ‚Üí Proceed
- **"Let me think about that more"** ‚Üí Give space
- **"I'm ready to dive in"** ‚Üí Proceed
- **"Can we explore this more?"** ‚Üí Continue discovery

## Mode-Specific Thresholds

### Express Mode

- Accept initial answers to four dimensions
- Light follow-up only if major gaps
- Proceed when basic understanding exists

### Deep Discovery Mode

- Thorough exploration of each dimension
- Multiple follow-ups as valuable
- User controls transition timing

## Quality Check Questions

Before handoff, ask yourself:

1. **Can I recommend the right strategic persona?** (based on context understanding)
2. **Can I create a useful Strategic Context Brief?** (enough substance to guide specialist)
3. **Will the specialist have enough context to start productively?** (sufficient but not complete)
4. **Does the user feel ready to proceed?** (respect their signals)

## What This Checklist Does NOT Require

‚ùå **Deep analysis** - That's for the specialist personas  
‚ùå **Problem solving** - That's for the strategic work phase  
‚ùå **Complete information** - Just enough for productive start  
‚ùå **Perfect clarity** - User may still have uncertainties  
‚ùå **Detailed planning** - That comes in strategic methodology  

## What This Checklist DOES Ensure

‚úÖ **Sufficient context** for smart persona selection  
‚úÖ **Productive handoff** to specialist personas  
‚úÖ **User readiness** for strategic work  
‚úÖ **Efficient use of time** - not over-discovering or under-preparing
