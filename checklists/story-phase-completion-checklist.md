# STORY Phase Completion Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that the STORY phase (Strategic Communicator) has completed all essential work before transitioning to the DECIDE phase. This checklist ensures strategic insights have been transformed into compelling narratives that inform and influence stakeholder thinking about critical strategic decisions.

## What This Phase Accomplishes

The STORY phase makes strategic insights accessible and persuasive. The Strategic Communicator ensures:
- Complex analysis becomes compelling narrative
- Insights are tailored to different stakeholders
- Case for action is compelling
- Key messages are consistent across audiences
- Foundation for decision-making is solid

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Core Strategic Narrative Developed ✓

- [ ] **Master narrative created**
  - Clear story arc (current state → challenge → analysis → insight → choice point)
  - Core message repeated throughout
  - Evidence woven into story (not appended as separate analysis)
  - Emotional resonance with audience
  - Call-to-action (what decision/action is being informed)

- [ ] **Narrative logic is clear**
  - Each element builds on previous
  - Why we did certain analyses is clear
  - Why certain findings matter is explained
  - Implications are front-and-center (not buried)
  - Path to decision is visible

- [ ] **Narrative is evidence-based**
  - Claims are supported by findings
  - Supporting data provided
  - Caveats and uncertainties acknowledged
  - Tone is credible (not overselling)

**What This Looks Like:**
```
NARRATIVE ARC:
Current State: Enterprise success, SMB challenges
Challenge: Market opportunity vs. resource constraints
Analysis: Deep dive into churn, competition, opportunity
Insight: Double-sided growth opportunity (enterprise + SMB)
Choice Point: Do we defend premium or expand downmarket?
Call-to-Action: Strategic decision needed by [date]
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect storytelling
- ❌ Polished presentation
- ❌ Unanimous agreement with narrative
- ❌ Final decision on what to do

### 2. Stakeholder Narratives Customized ✓

  - Affected teams/departments
  - External stakeholders (if relevant)

- [ ] **Customized narratives for each group**
  - For executives: Strategic implications and business impact
  - For operations: What this means for their areas, what changes

- **For Product:** "Analysis shows feature gaps vs. competitors; two possible strategic responses (premium features for enterprise OR simplified feature set for SMB); strategic direction needed"
- **For Board:** "Market analysis shows $500M opportunity in adjacent segment; current strategy captures enterprise (stable, profitable); opportunity to expand total addressable market"

**What This Does NOT Require:**

## Quality Checks (Before Handoff)

   - Could someone understand the logic without detailed data?
   - Do they see why analysis was conducted?
   - Do implications flow logically from findings?
   - Is path to decision clear?

3. **Are stakeholders adequately addressed?**
   - Would each key group understand what this means for them?
   - Are their concerns/perspectives represented?
   - Would they feel heard and understood?
   - Would they be ready to engage in decision?

4. **Does the Communicator feel the story is ready?**
   - Are they confident in the narrative?
   - Can they answer questions about findings?
   - Are they ready to hand off to Advisor?
   - Do they feel the story is compelling?

  - → Ensure evidence supports each

- **Executive communication weak?**
  - → Simplify the brief
  - → Focus on implications (not just findings)
  - → Clarify decision needed

## Common Blockers & How to Resolve

| Blocker | Signal | Resolution |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Narrative feels data-heavy** | "Too many numbers" | Weave evidence into story; don't append analysis |
| **No emotional resonance** | "It's interesting but who cares?" | Add examples, customer stories, real impact |
| **Too many messages** | "We have 15 key messages" | Ruthlessly consolidate; focus on 3-5 core |

| **Decision unclear** | "What are we actually deciding?" | Articulate explicitly; outline options |
| **Overcomplicated** | "Too hard to explain" | Simplify story arc; focus on essentials |
