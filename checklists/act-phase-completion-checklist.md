# ACT Phase Completion Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that the ACT phase (Strategic Advisor + Strategic Innovator) has completed all essential work to transition from strategic planning to operational execution. This checklist ensures the strategic decision has been translated into a detailed, actionable, innovation-enriched implementation plan that guides organizational execution.

## What This Phase Accomplishes

The ACT phase operationalizes strategy. The Strategic Advisor and Innovator together ensure:
- Strategy is translated into executable plan
- Innovation opportunities are integrated
- Accountability and ownership are clear
- Resources are allocated and sequenced
- Success metrics are defined
- Organization is ready to execute
