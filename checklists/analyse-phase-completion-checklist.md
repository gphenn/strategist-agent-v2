# ANALYSE Phase Completion Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that the ANALYSE phase (Strategic Analyst + Strategic Specialist) has completed all essential work before transitioning to the INSIGHT phase. This checklist ensures hypotheses have been systematically tested, data has been rigorously analyzed, and patterns have been identified that support strategic decision-making.

## What This Phase Accomplishes

The ANALYSE phase transforms hypotheses into evidence-based insights. The Analyst and Specialist together ensure:
- All key hypotheses are systematically tested
- Quantitative data supports findings
- Competitive landscape is understood
- Patterns and trends are identified
- Findings are documented with supporting evidence

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Hypothesis Testing Completion ✓

- [ ] **All priority hypotheses have been tested**
  - High-impact hypotheses: all tested
  - Medium-impact hypotheses: all tested
  - Quick-win hypotheses: tested (or explicitly deferred with reason)
  - At least 80% of hypotheses from SPLIT phase tested

- [ ] **Testing evidence is documented**
  - For each hypothesis: data/evidence gathered
  - Testing methodology documented
  - Sample sizes adequate (or limitations noted)
  - Data sources credible and traceable

- [ ] **Hypotheses validated or refuted**
  - Each hypothesis has clear conclusion: supported, refuted, or inconclusive
  - Strength of evidence assessed (strong, moderate, weak)
  - Confidence level in conclusion noted
  - Boundary conditions identified (when hypothesis holds true)

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Hypothesis:** "SMB customers churn due to pricing"
  - **Testing:** Exit interviews (15 customers), pricing analysis (vs. 5 competitors), market research
  - **Evidence:** 12/15 exit interviews cited price; we're 20-30% higher than closest competitor; market research confirms price sensitivity in SMB
  - **Conclusion:** **STRONGLY SUPPORTED** - price is primary driver for SMB churn
  - **Boundary:** Applies to SMB segment <100 employees; enterprise less price sensitive

- **Hypothesis:** "Product mobile experience drives enterprise churn"
  - **Testing:** Feature gap analysis, NPS by device type, customer interviews
  - **Evidence:** Mobile is 15% of usage; desktop-only features not major complaint; NPS similar across device types
  - **Conclusion:** **REFUTED** - not a primary churn driver; secondary concern
  - **Alternative Found:** Enterprise customers want advanced integrations (API quality)

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Statistical significance testing
- ❌ Peer-reviewed academic rigor
- ❌ Testing of tangential hypotheses
- ❌ Proof beyond reasonable doubt (strong evidence is enough)

---

### 2. Quantitative Analysis ✓

  - Assumptions documented and validated

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Financial Impact:** We're losing $5M ARR to churn; competitor pricing costs us 12-15% of SMB revenue; market is growing at 25% annually but we're growing at 8%
- **Market Analysis:** $2B addressable SMB market; 5 major competitors; market consolidating around feature-rich solutions
- **Performance Gap:** We're priced 25% above market average; NPS 15 points below competitors; customer retention is 85% vs. 95% industry average
- **Models:** NPV of $50M opportunity if we reduce churn by 5%; breakeven in 18 months on pricing change

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect data
- ❌ Multiple years of trend data
- ❌ Complex financial modeling
- ❌ Competitive intelligence on every competitor

- **Feature Comparison:**
  - Us vs. Competitor X: They have mobile app (we don't); we have better integrations; they're faster to deploy
  - Pricing: We're 25% higher; they have aggressive SMB pricing
- **Differentiation:** Our strength is enterprise features; weakness is SMB pricing; opportunity is integration ecosystem
- **Threat:** Company X launching SMB pricing tier; Opportunity: their complexity alienates SMB segment

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Every competitor analyzed in detail
- ❌ Sales intelligence on competitive pricing
- ❌ Predictive competitive strategy
- ❌ Patent analysis or technology depth

  - Secondary: Feature gaps for growing SMB (30% of churn)
  - Tertiary: Competitive displacement (10% of churn)
- **Insight:** We're winning the customer acquisition battle but losing mid-market customers to scale-up competitor offering; we need pricing flexibility strategy
- **Leverage Point:** If we create SMB-specific pricing tier, we could retain 60% of churning customers; incremental revenue $3M+

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfectly explained variance
- ❌ Complete causal proof
- ❌ Statistical models

- **Methodology:** Churn analysis (SQL queries, triangulated across 3 sources); exit interviews (open-ended, coded for themes); competitive analysis (feature matrix, pricing sheets); market research (secondary)
- **Assumptions:** Exit interviews represent larger population (acknowledged bias toward more engaged customers); pricing data reflects public pricing only (actual deals likely different)
- **Confidence Levels:**
  - HIGH: SMB churn rates by cohort (internal data, clean)
  - MODERATE: Price sensitivity (exit interviews, market data, but small sample)
  - EXPLORATORY: Enterprise feature needs (few interviews, anecdotal evidence)

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Primary research on all hypotheses

## Quality Checks (Before Handoff)

Before confirming phase completion, ask yourself:

1. **Have we thoroughly tested the hypotheses?**
   - Did we find evidence for each major hypothesis?
   - Did we consider alternative explanations?
   - Would the findings hold up to scrutiny?

2. **Does the analysis answer the original questions?**
   - Can we explain why the problem exists?
   - Do we understand the business impact?
   - Can we identify root causes vs. symptoms?

3. **Is the analysis actionable?**
   - Do findings point toward possible solutions?
   - Can we understand what to fix?
   - Are priorities clear?

4. **Do the Analyst and Specialist both feel the analysis is complete?**
   - Do they have confidence in findings?
   - Are there nagging doubts or gaps?
   - Are they ready to hand off?
