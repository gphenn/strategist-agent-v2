# Strategic Brief Validation Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that a completed Strategic Brief contains all essential sections with sufficient depth and clarity to serve as the executive summary of strategic work. This checklist ensures the brief can stand alone as a comprehensive strategic document.

## What Gets Validated

**Template Reference:** `templates/strategic-brief-tmpl.md`

**Used In:** DEFINE, STORY, and DECIDE phases as final executive summary

**Audience:** Executives, board, key stakeholders who need complete strategic picture without reading full analysis

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Executive Summary ✓

- [ ] **Opening paragraph captures full strategic situation**
  - What's the business challenge or opportunity?
  - Why does it matter (business impact)?
  - What's the strategic question being addressed?
  - Can someone understand the situation from this alone?

- [ ] **1-2 page summary is scannable**
  - Bold headers break up text
  - Key findings highlighted
  - Not dense paragraphs (bullets where appropriate)
  - Length is truly brief (1-2 pages maximum)

- [ ] **Tone is executive-appropriate**
  - Professional and credible
  - Evidence-based (not speculative)
  - Action-oriented (not descriptive)
  - Clear and direct (not academic)

**What This Looks Like:**
```
SITUATION:
We're experiencing 15% annual customer churn in our SMB segment,
representing $5M in lost ARR. Competitors are moving aggressively
downmarket with simplified, lower-cost offerings. Simultaneously,
our enterprise segment is highly stable (95% retention, $15M ARR)
with strong growth potential.

STRATEGIC QUESTION:
Should we expand into the SMB segment with a separate offering,
or maintain our focus on enterprise excellence?

KEY FINDINGS:
- SMB churn is driven primarily by pricing (60%) and feature gaps (30%)
- Enterprise customers are highly satisfied and loyal
- Market opportunity in SMB is substantial ($2B TAM; 25% annual growth)
- Competitors are establishing SMB presence; window may be time-limited
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Complete detailed analysis
- ❌ All supporting data
- ❌ Every finding detailed
- ❌ Polished presentation formatting

---

### 2. Problem/Opportunity Statement ✓

- [ ] **Problem is clearly and specifically stated**
  - Not vague or abstract
  - Business impact is quantified
  - Scope boundaries are defined
  - Root causes are indicated (without full analysis)

- [ ] **Problem statement could be understood by anyone**
  - Technical jargon is minimized
  - Context is provided where needed
  - Not assuming prior knowledge
  - Clarity over perfection

- [ ] **Problem connects to business strategy**
  - Why does this matter to the company?
  - How does it relate to strategic priorities?
  - What's at stake if not addressed?
  - Why now?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
We face a strategic inflection point. Our enterprise-focused
positioning has been highly successful ($15M ARR, 95% retention),
but it's left a significant market opportunity on the table. The SMB
segment we're not serving ($2B market, 25% growth) is being captured
by competitors with lower-cost, simpler offerings. Meanwhile, churn
in our existing SMB customers ($5M ARR) is running at 15% annually—
double our enterprise rate—primarily due to pricing misalignment.

STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:
This is not a tactical problem (which we could solve with pricing
tweaks). It's a strategic choice about whether we defend our
premium, enterprise-only positioning or leverage our success to
capture a larger market opportunity. The window for response is
limited—competitive positioning suggests 12-18 months before the
SMB market consolidates around fewer players.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Root cause proof (just indication)
- ❌ Complete market analysis
- ❌ Multiple perspectives
- ❌ Detailed financial impact

---

### 3. Key Findings (Evidence-Based) ✓

- [ ] **Major findings are stated clearly**
  - What did analysis reveal?
  - Each finding is specific (not general)
  - Findings are supported by evidence
  - Findings connect to problem statement

- [ ] **Evidence for findings is provided**
  - Data/research backing finding cited
  - Confidence level indicated (proven, strong, moderate, exploratory)
  - Limitations acknowledged if relevant
  - Assumptions stated if used

- [ ] **Findings tell a coherent story**
  - They build on each other logically
  - Together they explain the situation
  - They point toward decision needed
  - They're not random facts

**What This Looks Like:**
```
KEY FINDINGS:

1. SMB CHURN IS DRIVEN BY PRICING MISALIGNMENT (High Confidence)
   Finding: SMB customers churn because we're 25-30% more expensive
   than primary competitors; exit interviews showed price cited as
   primary reason in 80% of churned accounts.
   Evidence: Internal churn data (CRM); 15 exit interviews;
   competitive pricing analysis
   Confidence: HIGH (internal data validated by multiple sources)

2. ENTERPRISE SEGMENT IS HIGHLY STABLE (High Confidence)
   Finding: Enterprise customers are highly satisfied (NPS 75+)
   and very loyal (95% retention); they value advanced features
   and support quality over cost.
   Evidence: Internal retention/NPS data; enterprise customer interviews
   Confidence: HIGH (clear trend in data)

3. SMB MARKET OPPORTUNITY IS SUBSTANTIAL (Moderate Confidence)
   Finding: SMB addressable market is ~$2B; market is growing at
   25% annually; competitors are consolidating around simplified
   feature sets.
   Evidence: Third-party market research (18 months old);
   customer feedback; competitive analysis
   Confidence: MODERATE (secondary research; may have aged)

4. COMPETITIVE WINDOW IS TIME-LIMITED (Moderate Confidence)
   Finding: Competitors are establishing SMB presence aggressively;
   market may consolidate within 12-18 months, making entry harder.
   Evidence: Competitive monitoring; customer feedback about
   competitor offers; market trends
   Confidence: MODERATE (based on pattern observation, not definitive)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Exhaustive findings list
- ❌ Complete supporting data
- ❌ Perfect confidence levels
- ❌ All methodologies detailed

---

### 4. Strategic Implications & Insights ✓

- [ ] **"So what?" is clearly articulated**
  - What do findings mean for strategy?
  - What strategic choices are emerging?
  - What are we learning about market position?
  - What does this suggest about future?

- [ ] **Trade-offs are made visible**
  - What do we gain with each strategic option?
  - What do we give up?
  - What are we choosing between?
  - Why are trade-offs important?

- [ ] **Opportunities are identified**
  - What becomes possible with this understanding?
  - Where is growth opportunity?
  - What competitive advantage emerges?
  - What could we do that competitors can't?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:

Our analysis reveals a strategic inflection point: we have successfully
dominated the enterprise market, but in doing so, we've become a premium
player with limited ability to capture the adjacent, larger SMB market.
This isn't a problem to be fixed with tactics; it's a strategic choice.

CHOICE POINT 1: Market Focus
- OPTION A: Defend our premium, enterprise-only positioning
  Gain: Simplicity; maximize enterprise profitability; clear focus
  Give Up: $2B market opportunity; future growth; market share

- OPTION B: Pursue dual-segment strategy (enterprise + SMB)
  Gain: Larger market opportunity; growth potential; market leadership
  Give Up: Organizational simplicity; resource split; near-term profitability

OPPORTUNITY:
If we can serve both enterprise and SMB profitably with distinct
offerings, we could double our addressable market and achieve
market leadership position. Enterprise excellence becomes our
strength; SMB value becomes our reach.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
We have something competitors don't: proven enterprise success
(retention, NPS, product quality). We could leverage that to move
downmarket with confidence—taking best practices from enterprise
and adapting them for SMB simplicity/affordability.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Final recommendation
- ❌ Detailed implementation approach
- ❌ Complete strategic analysis
- ❌ Quantified opportunity sizing

### 5. Recommendations or Framing for Decision ✓

- [ ] **Clear recommendation OR clear decision framing**
  - If recommending: Option A is recommended because [rationale]
  - If framing decision: Here are the strategic choices and trade-offs
  - Rationale is clear and defensible
  - Recommendation connects to findings

- [ ] **Next steps are articulated**
  - What should happen next?
  - Who decides?
  - What's timeline for decision?
  - What work happens while deciding?

- [ ] **Success criteria are outlined**
  - What does success look like for recommended approach?
  - What metrics matter?
  - What's the target timeframe?
  - How will we measure success?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
RECOMMENDATION:
Pursue a dual-segment strategy with distinct enterprise and SMB
offerings. Rationale: This approach leverages our proven enterprise
strength, captures the substantial SMB opportunity before market
consolidates, and creates defensible market leadership position.

ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED:
Enterprise-only focus offers simplicity but leaves significant market
opportunity to competitors. Risk: competitors establish SMB dominance;
we become legacy enterprise player.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Executive decision on strategic direction (this month)
2. If approved, detailed planning for dual-segment execution
   (next quarter)
3. Phase 1 execution: Foundation (Months 1-6)
4. Phase 2 execution: Launch and scale (Months 6-18)

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Enterprise: Maintain $15M+ ARR, >90% retention, NPS >75
- SMB: Reach $10M ARR by Year 2, >80% retention
- Combined: Path to $40M ARR by Year 3; profitability >40%
- Competitive: Establish market leadership in both segments
