# DEFINE Phase Completion Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that the DEFINE phase (Strategic Analyst) has completed all essential work before transitioning to the SPLIT phase. This checklist ensures the problem or opportunity is sufficiently clarified, quantified, and documented for productive strategic decomposition.

## What This Phase Accomplishes

The DEFINE phase transforms vague business challenges into clearly articulated, measurable problems ready for systematic analysis. The Strategic Analyst ensures we understand:
- What the problem/opportunity actually is
- Why it matters (business impact)
- Who is affected
- How we'll measure success

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Problem/Opportunity Clarity ✓

- [ ] **Problem/opportunity is clearly articulated**
  - User can describe it in 1-2 sentences without ambiguity
  - Core issue is distinct from symptoms
  - Scope boundaries are defined (what's in/out of scope)

- [ ] **Business context is documented**
  - Current market/competitive landscape captured
  - Organizational context understood (size, structure, capabilities)
  - Strategic priorities that this addresses identified
  - Relevant stakeholder landscape outlined

- [ ] **Problem has quantifiable impact**
  - Financial impact estimated (revenue at risk, cost, margin impact)
  - Scope measured in business terms (market size, customer count, process volume)
  - Time sensitivity established (when does this need to be addressed?)
  - Baseline metrics captured (current state measurement)

**What This Looks Like:**
- "We're losing 15% of customers annually to competitor X, costing us $5M in ARR. We need to understand why and develop competitive response strategy."
- NOT: "We have competitive challenges"

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Root cause analysis
- ❌ Detailed competitive intelligence
- ❌ Complete market data
- ❌ Precise impact calculation

---

### 2. Success Criteria & Target State ✓

- [ ] **Success criteria are explicitly defined**
  - At least 3 measurable success metrics identified
  - Each metric has a target (not just direction)
  - Metrics are outcome-focused, not activity-focused
  - Success is testable and observable

- [ ] **Target state is articulated**
  - Desired future state described
  - What "solved" looks like for stakeholders
  - Constraints and realities acknowledged
  - Difference between current and target is clear

**What This Looks Like:**
- Success Metric 1: "Reduce customer churn from 15% to 5% annually"
- Success Metric 2: "Achieve 80% Net Promoter Score (vs. 62% current)"
- Success Metric 3: "Develop defensible competitive differentiation"

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Detailed measurement methodology
- ❌ Complete implementation plan
- ❌ Guaranteed achievability

---

### 3. Stakeholder Mapping ✓

- [ ] **Key stakeholders identified**
  - Decision makers named and role clarified
  - Implementers/executors identified
  - Affected groups identified (internal and external)
  - Internal champions and resistors noted

- [ ] **Stakeholder positions understood**
  - Key stakeholder priorities captured
  - Potential conflicts or misalignments identified
  - Power/influence dynamics noted
  - Communication preferences understood (where possible)

**What This Looks Like:**
- CEO (Decision): Wants proven ROI and quick wins
- VP Sales (Implementer): Concerned about customer messaging
- Customer Advisory Board (Affected): Wants faster response time
- Board of Directors (Decision): Wants clear competitive advantage

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Detailed influence analysis
- ❌ Change management plan
- ❌ Complete stakeholder mapping (just key stakeholders)

  - Relevant historical data reviewed
  - Current performance data collected
  - Market context researched (high-level)
  - Preliminary competitive landscape sketch created

  - Market assumptions noted
  - Operational assumptions listed
  - Risk/uncertainty factors identified

**What This Looks Like:**
- Key Questions:
  - "Why are we losing these specific customers?"
  - "What do competitors offer that we don't?"
  - "What's our sustainable competitive advantage?"
- Data Gaps:
  - "Need lost customer exit interviews"
  - "Need detailed competitive pricing analysis"
  - "Need market research on customer preferences"

**What This Does NOT Require:**

  - Risk considerations noted

- [ ] **All work products organized**
  - Analysis work documented
  - Data sources referenced
  - Preliminary findings captured
  - Research artifacts linked
  - Documentation accessible to next persona

**What This Looks Like:**
- Strategic Brief: 2-3 page document with problem, context, impact, success criteria
- Handoff Doc: 1-2 page transition document highlighting key insights and questions
- Supporting Materials: Raw data, research notes, stakeholder interviews

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Polished presentation
- ❌ Full competitor analysis
- ❌ Complete market data
- ❌ Implementation recommendations

- [ ] **Context brief includes scenario considerations**
  - Best case scenario sketched
  - Worst case scenario sketched
  - Most likely scenario articulated

- [ ] **Preliminary insights identified**
  - Preliminary patterns noted
  - Initial hypotheses about root causes formed

## Quality Checks (Before Handoff)

Before confirming phase completion, ask yourself:

1. **Can the Strategic Specialist productively decompose this problem?**
   - Is the problem clear enough to break down?
   - Are boundaries defined?
   - Would more clarity help or would it emerge during decomposition?

2. **Will the Specialist know what questions to investigate?**
   - Are analytical questions clearly framed?
   - Are data gaps identified?
   - Are assumptions explicit?

3. **Can we measure success when we're done?**
   - Are metrics specific enough?
   - Are targets clear?
   - Can we track progress?

4. **Does the user feel confident about the problem definition?**
   - Have they confirmed their own clarity?
   - Do they feel heard and understood?
   - Are they ready to move forward?

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready to Proceed to SPLIT When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Problem is clear, quantified, and bounded
- Success criteria are defined and measurable
- Key stakeholders are identified
- Analytical foundation is established
- Documentation is complete and handed off

**The Specialist will have sufficient foundation to decompose the problem effectively.**

---

### 🔄 Needs More Work When

One or more blocking criteria are unmet:

- **Problem still unclear?**
  - → Spend more time on problem articulation
  - → Interview additional stakeholders
  - → Refine scope boundaries

- **Impact not quantified?**
  - → Gather more financial data
  - → Define business metrics
  - → Establish baseline measurements

- **Success criteria vague?**
  - → Define specific, measurable targets
  - → Get stakeholder agreement on metrics
  - → Clarify trade-offs between criteria

- **Stakeholders not understood?**
  - → Map power/interest/influence dynamics
  - → Interview key stakeholders
  - → Identify alignment/conflict areas

## Common Blockers & How to Resolve

| Blocker | Signal | Resolution |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Problem too vague** | "It's complicated" | Use problem-structuring task to clarify |
| **Impact unmeasured** | No numbers mentioned | Gather baseline data and financial impact |
| **Scope too large** | Affects everything | Narrow to specific area; plan phased approach |
| **Stakeholders misaligned** | Conflicting views | Interview each stakeholder separately; document |
| **Success undefined** | "We'll know it when we see it" | Define specific, measurable metrics |
| **Data unavailable** | "We don't have that" | Identify what IS available; proceed with assumptions |
