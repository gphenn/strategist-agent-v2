market opportunity.

TIMING:
We're profitable and stable in enterprise. Decision needed in next
quarter before competitive window closes and resources needed to execute.

USER'S PERSPECTIVE:
CEO believes we should explore SMB opportunity but has concerns about
organizational distraction and execution risk. VP Sales thinks we need
to fix SMB pricing/positioning. Product team concerned about feature
complexity vs. SMB simplicity needs.

What would prove wrong: If other factors (support, brand) are primary drivers

Assumption 2: SMB market opportunity is substantial
Evidence: Market research reports; customer inquiry patterns

KNOWN UNKNOWNS:

Unknown 1: What specifically drives SMB churn? (Price? Features? Support?)
Why important: Determines strategic response options
How to learn: Exit interviews, cohort analysis, competitive analysis
Priority: CRITICAL (fundamental to decision)

Unknown 2: What is SMB market demand/TAM for our solution?
Why important: Determines opportunity size
How to learn: Market research, customer interviews, TAM analysis
Priority: CRITICAL

Unknown 3: Can we profitably serve both enterprise and SMB?
Why important: Determines feasibility of dual-segment strategy
How to learn: Unit economics analysis, business modeling
Priority: HIGH

Unknown 4: Would our current enterprise customers object to SMB focus?
Why important: Determines execution risk

### 5. Discovery Insights Documented ✓

  - What points to investigate?

- [ ] **Customer/stakeholder voice included**
  - What did users/customers say?

  - Are quotes/examples provided?

- [ ] **Red flags or opportunities noted**
  - What should we watch for?
  - What opportunities emerged?
  - What concerns were raised?
  - What areas need focus?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
KEY DISCOVERY FINDINGS:

Finding 1: SMB Customer Dissatisfaction Pattern
- Multiple SMB customers mentioned pricing as primary concern
- Described our solution as "enterprise-grade for SMB needs"
- Expressed frustration with feature complexity
- Noted competitors offer simpler, cheaper alternatives
Implication: SMB market willing to trade advanced features for simplicity/price

Finding 2: Enterprise Customer Strength
- Enterprise customers express high satisfaction
- Specifically value integration breadth and customization
- NPS scores are strong (75+)
- Long-term contracts and expansion deals common
Implication: Enterprise positioning is winning; don't lose focus

Finding 3: Market Dynamics Shift
- Multiple sources mentioned competitor downmarket moves
- Customer advisory board flagged competitive threat in SMB
- Competitive landscape consolidating around two tiers
Implication: Window for SMB entry may be time-limited

Finding 4: Product-Market Fit Questions
- SMB customers asking for simplified feature sets
- Enterprise customers want advanced features and customization
- Same product serving both seems challenging
Implication: May need separate product/positioning for SMB

CUSTOMER VOICE:

Quote from Churned SMB Customer:
"You're great for enterprise, but you're overkill for what we need. We'd
pay $500/month, not $5K/month. We found a competitor that gives us 80%
of the features at 20% of the cost."

Quote from Enterprise Customer:
"Your integration ecosystem is why we chose you. We need 15+ integrations
to work seamlessly. Most of your competitors can't do this."

Quote from Sales Team:
"We're losing SMB deals to Competitor Z on price every week. They're not
as capable, but they're 'good enough' and cheap. We can't compete on price
with our current positioning."

RED FLAGS:

Flag 1: Organizational capability concern
- Building/supporting dual-segment business is different from
  current enterprise focus
- Team has enterprise DNA; SMB is different
- Execution risk is real

Flag 2: Timing concern
- Market window for SMB entry estimated at 12-18 months
- Competitive moves happening now
- Decision timeline is critical

OPPORTUNITIES:

Opportunity 1: Leverage enterprise strength
- Our enterprise success is competitive advantage in SMB
- We could position as "enterprise-grade reliability for SMB simplicity"
- Reference customers could help SMB sales

Opportunity 2: Build integration ecosystem for SMB
- SMB increasingly wants integrations
- If we could provide 10-15 key integrations at SMB price point,
  would be compelling
- Different from enterprise integration depth
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Complete discovery notes
- ❌ All customer interviews transcribed
- ❌ Exhaustive stakeholder feedback
- ❌ Perfect organization of insights
