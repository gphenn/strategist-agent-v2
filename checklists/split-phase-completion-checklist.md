# SPLIT Phase Completion Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that the SPLIT phase (Strategic Specialist) has completed all essential work before transitioning to the ANALYSE phase. This checklist ensures the problem or opportunity has been decomposed into analyzable components with clear hypotheses and investigation priorities.

## What This Phase Accomplishes

The SPLIT phase takes a complex problem and breaks it into manageable pieces. The Strategic Specialist ensures:
- The problem is systematically decomposed
- Root causes are theorized (not yet proven)
- Hypotheses are testable
- Analysis questions are prioritized
- Investigation approach is structured

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Problem Decomposition ✓

- [ ] **Problem broken into logical components**
  - Problem structure is MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
  - All aspects of problem addressed in decomposition
  - Components are at analyzable level (not too broad, not too granular)
  - Relationships between components identified

- [ ] **Problem structure is documented**
  - Issue tree or problem tree created
  - Each level logically justified
  - Major branches labeled clearly
  - Sub-components explicit and testable

- [ ] **Problem boundaries are maintained**
  - Decomposition respects original scope
  - Doesn't introduce new out-of-scope areas
  - Stays focused on the core challenge
  - Cross-functional dependencies noted

**What This Looks Like:**
```
Core Problem: Customer churn 15% annually ($5M ARR)
├─ Why are customers leaving? (Root causes)
│  ├─ Product dissatisfaction
│  ├─ Competitive pressure
│  └─ Price sensitivity
├─ Who is leaving? (Segmentation)
│  ├─ SMB segment
│  ├─ Enterprise segment
│  └─ Geographic variance
└─ When are they leaving? (Timeline)
   ├─ Within first 6 months
   ├─ Year 1-2
   └─ Year 3+
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Detailed analysis of each branch
- ❌ Definitive root cause identification
- ❌ Complete stakeholder input on structure
- ❌ Perfect decomposition (good enough is fine)

---

### 2. Hypothesis Formation ✓

- [ ] **Root cause hypotheses formulated**
  - For each major problem branch, hypothesis stated
  - Hypotheses are testable ("If/Then" format)
  - Hypotheses are grounded in initial evidence or logic
  - Alternative hypotheses considered and noted

- [ ] **Hypotheses are prioritized**
  - High-impact hypotheses identified (biggest business effect if true)
  - High-probability hypotheses identified (most likely to be true)
  - Priority ranking established for investigation
  - Quick-win hypotheses separated from deep-dive ones

- [ ] **Hypothesis testing approach outlined**
  - For each hypothesis, testing approach identified
  - Data/evidence needed specified
  - Validation criteria defined (what proves/disproves?)
  - Relative effort estimated for each test

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Hypothesis 1 (High Impact/Probability):** "Customers in SMB segment churn because competitors offer lower prices"
  - Test: Compare pricing vs. top 3 competitors; interview churned SMB customers
  - Validation: "Supported if 60%+ of SMB churn cite price; refuted if less than 20%"

- **Hypothesis 2 (High Impact/Lower Probability):** "Product gaps in mobile experience drive enterprise churn"
  - Test: Feature gap analysis; NPS analysis by customer type; interviews
  - Validation: "Supported if mobile is top 3 pain point for 40%+ enterprise customers"

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Definitive proof of hypotheses
- ❌ Complete testing methodology
- ❌ Quantified probability estimates
- ❌ Perfect hypothesis wording

---

### 3. Analysis Framework ✓

- [ ] **Analysis work plan created**
  - All analysis tasks identified (what analyses are needed?)
  - Sequencing established (what order makes sense?)
  - Dependencies noted (which analyses inform others?)
  - Resource requirements estimated

- [ ] **Key investigation questions defined**
  - For each problem component, key questions listed
  - Questions are specific and answerable
  - Questions connected to hypotheses
  - Answers will inform decisions

- [ ] **Data gaps and sources identified**
  - What data exists internally (available, accessible)
  - What external research is needed
  - What interviews/primary research required
  - Feasibility of gathering each type assessed

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Investigation Questions for Product Dissatisfaction:**
  - "What specific features are customers requesting most?"
  - "How does our feature set compare to competitors?"
  - "Which features drive highest usage/satisfaction?"

- **Data Sources:**
  - Internal: Customer feedback database, support tickets, usage analytics
  - External: Competitive feature analysis, market research
  - Primary: Customer interviews, advisory board feedback

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Complete analysis plan (high-level is fine)
- ❌ All data gathered
- ❌ Final analysis questions (these can evolve)
- ❌ Statistical study design

---

### 4. Root Cause Investigation Path ✓

- [ ] **Root causes theorized (not proven)**
  - Apparent root causes identified for each major branch
  - Multiple potential causes considered
  - Surface causes vs. deeper drivers distinguished
  - Causal mechanisms explained (why does this cause churn?)

- [ ] **Assumptions about root causes documented**
  - What we believe to be true (without proof)
  - Why we believe it (logic, preliminary evidence, pattern)
  - What evidence would prove/disprove it
  - Risk if assumption is wrong

- [ ] **Root cause relationships mapped**
  - How different root causes interact
  - Primary vs. secondary causes identified
  - Feedback loops noted (if any)
  - Leverage points identified (where to focus fix efforts)

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Primary Root Cause:** Competitor X launched feature Y that matches customer need better than our solution
  - **Secondary Root Causes:** We haven't communicated our roadmap; we haven't invested in that feature area
  - **Leverage Point:** Either develop competitive feature OR significantly improve communications about differentiation
  - **Evidence Needed:** Customer preference research, competitive analysis, roadmap review

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Proven root causes
- ❌ Quantified impact of each root cause
- ❌ Complete fishbone/cause-effect diagrams
- ❌ Five-whys analysis (though helpful)

---

### 5. Strategic Coherence ✓

- [ ] **Decomposition connects back to original problem**
  - All components together explain the full problem
  - No major aspect of original problem left unexplored
  - Scope hasn't drifted
  - Original success criteria still relevant

- [ ] **Specialist approach confirmed**
  - Systematic methodology chosen for this problem
  - Framework choices justified
  - Flexibility built in for emergent findings
  - Next phase (ANALYSE) will have clear direction

- [ ] **Stakeholder perspectives incorporated**
  - Different stakeholder views on root causes considered
  - Conflicting perspectives noted
  - Whose perspective will be validated first?
  - Communication plan for findings in place

**What This Looks Like:**
- Decomposition directly addresses original problem: "Why are we losing customers?"
- Not exploring: "How should we reorganize sales?" (different problem)
- Specialist approach: Systematic decomposition → hypothesis testing → root cause validation
- Multiple perspectives: CEO thinks competition; Sales thinks product; Product thinks marketing

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Complete stakeholder agreement
- ❌ Resolved perspective conflicts
- ❌ Final answer on whose perspective is correct

## Quality Checks (Before Handoff)

Before confirming phase completion, ask yourself:

1. **Will the Analyst understand what to analyze?**
   - Are components clearly defined?
   - Are hypotheses clear?
   - Will Analyst know what to look for?

2. **Is the analysis realistic and feasible?**
   - Can this be analyzed in reasonable timeframe?
   - Is data available or obtainable?
   - Are resources adequate?

3. **Will analysis provide decision-making insight?**
   - Does problem decomposition surface root causes?
   - Will hypothesis testing answer key questions?
   - Can results inform strategic decisions?

4. **Does the Specialist feel confident about the structure?**
   - Have they explored the problem thoroughly?
   - Do they feel good about the decomposition?
   - Are they ready to hand off?

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready to Proceed to ANALYSE When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Problem is decomposed into logical, analyzable components
- Hypotheses are formulated with testing approaches
- Analysis framework is clear and sequenced
- Root causes are theorized and documented
- Strategic coherence is maintained
- Documentation is complete and handed off

**The Analyst will have a clear road map for systematic investigation.**

---

### 🔄 Needs More Work When

One or more blocking criteria are unmet:

- **Decomposition feels incomplete?**
  - → Use problem-structuring task to refine
  - → Add missing branches
  - → Test MECE principle

- **Hypotheses unclear?**
  - → Use hypothesis-testing task framework
  - → Write If/Then statements
  - → Define validation criteria

- **Analysis approach undefined?**
  - → Identify what analyses are needed
  - → Sequence them logically
  - → Estimate effort and feasibility

- **Root causes not theorized?**
  - → Use root-cause-analysis task
  - → Consider multiple perspectives
  - → Distinguish likely from possible causes

## Common Blockers & How to Resolve

| Blocker | Signal | Resolution |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Decomposition not MECE** | Overlapping or missing categories | Use problem-structuring task; test with "does this cover everything uniquely?" |
| **Too many hypotheses** | List has 10+ items for one branch | Consolidate; focus on most impactful |
| **Hypotheses not testable** | "Customers are unhappy" | Reframe: "What specific pain point causes churn?" |
| **Analysis plan unrealistic** | "Need 6 months of data gathering" | Scope down; identify critical path items |
| **No data identified** | "We don't have this information" | Identify proxy data; plan interviews; make assumptions explicit |
| **Scope creeping** | Decomposition going into new areas | Return to original problem; stay focused |
