**Used In:** STORY phase for narrative development

**Audience:** Executives, board, stakeholders reviewing strategic narrative

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Clear Story Arc ✓

- [ ] **Opening sets context and hooks attention**
  - Problem/opportunity presented compellingly
  - Why audience should care
  - Stakes are clear
  - Invitation to journey

- [ ] **Middle builds evidence and logic**
  - Analysis presented in digestible form
  - Findings build toward conclusion
  - Evidence woven throughout (not separated)
  - Logical progression from facts to implications

- [ ] **Closing shows implications and calls to action**
  - What findings mean for future
  - Decision or action required
  - Clear recommendation or options
  - Path forward articulated

**What This Looks Like:**
```
OPENING:
"Our enterprise business is thriving. We've built a category-leading
platform trusted by Fortune 500 companies. $15M ARR. 95% retention.
We're winning in the market we've chosen. But here's the problem:
in winning the enterprise market, we've missed a much larger opportunity
in the SMB market growing next door. A $2B market is growing at 25%
annually. Competitors are entering. Our window to claim significant
share is closing. This isn't a problem to fix. It's a strategic choice."

MIDDLE:
"Let me show you what's happening. Our SMB customers are churning at
15% annually—double our enterprise rate. Why? Primarily price.
We're a $10K-50K solution; SMB wants something at $1K-5K. It's not
that our product isn't good; it's that it's over-engineered for their
needs. Meanwhile, competitors are doing exactly what we're avoiding:
serving the SMB market with simplified, affordable solutions.

But here's where this gets interesting. While we were perfecting
enterprise, something changed in the market. SMB moved from 'me too'
market followers to primary market. And SMB customers increasingly
want what enterprise customers have: integrations, reliability,
predictability. But at SMB prices and simplicity.

We have something competitors don't: proven enterprise success.
Reference customers. Product quality. Retention rates that prove
value. If we could bring enterprise-grade reliability to SMB-friendly
simplicity and pricing, we'd have something unique."

CLOSING:
"So the choice is clear. We can continue our enterprise-only strategy.
It's proven. It's profitable. But it leaves $2B on the table and makes
us vulnerable if competitors move upmarket and drive enterprise pricing
pressure.

Or we can pursue a dual-segment strategy. Separate products. Separate
go-to-market. Separate teams. One focused on enterprise excellence.
One focused on SMB accessibility. It's more complex. It requires
discipline. But it doubles our addressable market and positions us
for market leadership.

The data supports the second path. The market supports it. And the
opportunity window says we need to decide—and begin executing—soon.

What I need from you: approval to pursue dual-segment strategy and
$5M investment to execute over 18 months. What you'll get: path to
$40M+ revenue by Year 3 and defensible market leadership position."
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect storytelling
- ❌ Elaborate narrative devices
- ❌ Emotional manipulation

### 2. Evidence Woven into Narrative ✓

- [ ] **Findings are presented, not appended**
  - Data is integrated into story
  - Evidence supports claims
  - Numbers used when they matter
  - Sources transparent

- [ ] **Claims are supported by evidence**
  - "SMB customers churn at 15%" supported by data
  - "Competitors moving downmarket" with examples
  - "Market growing 25%" with source
  - No unsupported assertions

- [ ] **Confidence levels are clear**
  - What we're certain about vs. indicative
  - Where data is strong vs. exploratory
  - Caveats and limitations noted
  - Audience can assess credibility

**What This Looks Like:**
```
CLAIM: "SMB customers are churning at 15% annually"
EVIDENCE: "Our CRM data shows 40 of 250 SMB customers churned over
past 12 months. That's 16% actual rate. For comparison, enterprise
churn is 5%."
CONFIDENCE: "HIGH - this is our actual data"

CLAIM: "Price is the primary driver of SMB churn"
EVIDENCE: "We conducted exit interviews with 15 churned SMB customers.
Twelve cited price as primary reason. We also analyzed customer
success notes showing price concerns appear in 70% of at-risk accounts."
CONFIDENCE: "MODERATE - based on interviews and notes. Actual impact
could vary, but trend is clear."

CLAIM: "SMB market is $2B TAM growing at 25%"
EVIDENCE: "Third-party market research firm (Gartner, August 2024)
estimates $2B TAM. Multiple sources show 20-30% annual growth rates."
CONFIDENCE: "MODERATE - secondary research. Market moving fast.
Estimates vary $1.5B-3B depending on definition."
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Every claim cited
- ❌ Appendix of sources
- ❌ Academic-level documentation
- ❌ Perfect confidence assessment

---

### 3. Emotional Resonance Alongside Logic ✓

- [ ] **Story connects intellectually and emotionally**
  - Logic appeals to head
  - Stakes/implications appeal to heart
  - Audience cares about decision
  - Personal connection to outcome visible

- [ ] **Language is engaging and clear**
  - Not overly technical or academic
  - Active voice where possible
  - Concrete examples and specifics
  - Accessible to audience

- [ ] **Narrative momentum builds**
  - Opening creates curiosity
  - Middle sustains interest
  - Closing creates sense of urgency/opportunity
  - Audience wants to hear more

**What This Looks Like:**
```
EMOTIONAL APPEAL (not manipulation):

"Imagine you're a growing tech company with $2M in funding. You need
software to manage customer data and integrations. You find two options:

Option A: The enterprise solution. Feature-rich. Powerful. Reliable.
$50K annual contract. Requires implementation team. Learning curve.

Option B: The SMB solution. Simpler. Easier to use. $2K annual contract.
You're up and running in days.

You choose Option B. Not because it's inferior. But because it's
'good enough' for what you need. And the price and simplicity matter.

This is happening thousands of times in the SMB market right now.
And we're not winning those battles because we're Option A. We've
optimized for Option A. And while Option A is profitable, Option B
is where the market is moving."

LOGIC + EMOTION:
Intellectual: Market dynamics and opportunity size
Emotional: Recognition of missed customers, competitive threat, opportunity
Together: Sense that this is both right AND urgent
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Personal stories or anecdotes (not required)
- ❌ Dramatic language or hyperbole
- ❌ Theatrical presentation
- ❌ Perfect balance of head/heart

### 4. Clear Decision or Action Called For ✓

- [ ] **What's being asked is explicit**
  - What decision is needed?
  - What's the specific ask?
  - Timeline for decision
  - What happens next

- [ ] **Options are presented (if decision)**
  - What choices exist?
  - What would each mean?
  - What's recommended?
  - Why that recommendation?

- [ ] **Path forward is clear**
  - What happens if we decide yes?
  - What resources needed?
  - What's timeline?
  - What's success look like?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
THE ASK:
"I'm asking for two things:

1. Strategic approval to pursue a dual-segment strategy (enterprise +
SMB). This means separate products, separate teams, separate go-to-market.
Enterprise remains core focus and investment. SMB is additive opportunity.

2. Budget approval of $5M over 18 months to execute this strategy:
- $3M for product development (SMB product, simplified architecture)
- $1M for go-to-market (sales team, partnerships, marketing)
- $1M for operations (customer success, infrastructure)

WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES TO:
- Company becomes dual-segment operator (not venture scale-at-all-costs
  thinking, but profitable-growth mindset)
- R&D splits focus between enterprise evolution and SMB new product
- 18-month execution timeline to validate SMB viability
- Monthly reviews and milestone gates to ensure execution quality

WHAT YOU GET:
- Path to $40M+ revenue by Year 3 (vs. $25M enterprise-only)
- Market leadership position in both segments
- Defensible competitive moat (can't be beaten by pure price or pure
  feature plays)
- Optionality: if SMB works, we scale. If it struggles, we have proven
  enterprise business that remains strong.

TIMELINE:
- Decision: This month
- Execution start: Next month
- Phase 1 (Foundation): Months 1-6
- Phase 2 (Launch): Months 6-12
- Phase 3 (Scale): Months 12-18
- Review point: Month 18 (full assessment of viability)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Detailed implementation plan
- ❌ Complete business case
- ❌ Every possible scenario
- ❌ Risk mitigation for all risks

3. The Analysis (What did we learn?) - 2-3 pages
4. The Implications (What does it mean?) - 1 page
5. The Recommendation (What should we do?) - 1 page
6. The Path Forward (What happens next?) - ½ page

TOTAL: 6-8 pages (executive readable in 20-30 minutes)

TONE EXAMPLES:

Good: "SMB customers are churning at twice the rate of enterprise
customers, primarily because our pricing is misaligned with SMB budgets."
(Professional, clear, data-driven)

Not great: "Our SMB business is like a leaky bucket. Customers pour in,
but they're dripping out constantly." (Too metaphorical for executive
briefing)

Good: "We have an opportunity to capture $2B market while defending our
profitable enterprise position. The market window is likely 12-18 months
before competitive consolidation. Decision is strategic, not tactical."
(Clear stakes, urgency, significance)

Not great: "This is HUGE. We need to move NOW or we'll regret it forever!"
(Hyperbolic, less credible)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfectly polished prose
