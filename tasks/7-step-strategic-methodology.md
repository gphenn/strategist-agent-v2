### 3. Methodology Completion & Next Steps

- **Review & Integration:**
  - Ensure all 7 steps are completed satisfactorily
  - Identify any gaps or areas needing iteration
  - Confirm stakeholder alignment on recommendations
  
- **Implementation Readiness:**
  - Validate resource availability and organizational readiness

## Success Criteria

The 7-step methodology is complete when:

1. **Problem is clearly defined** with measurable criteria
2. **Analysis is comprehensive** and evidence-based
3. **Insights are compelling** and strategically relevant
4. **Recommendations are practical** and well-supported
5. **Implementation plan is realistic** and actionable
6. **Stakeholders are aligned** on approach and expectations
7. **Success metrics are established** for ongoing monitoring

## Common Iteration Points

- Return to **Step 1** if problem definition needs refinement
- Revisit **Steps 2-3** if analysis reveals new complexities
- Loop **Steps 4-5** if insights need strengthening
- Iterate **Steps 6-7** if implementation challenges emerge

Remember: Strategic thinking is iterative. Use this methodology as a guide, not a rigid process.
