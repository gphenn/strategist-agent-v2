# Strategic Decision Framework Task

## Purpose

To facilitate complex strategic decisions through structured evaluation frameworks, ensuring all key factors are considered and trade-offs are explicitly managed. This task drives high-quality decisions that balance multiple criteria and stakeholder interests.

## Inputs Required

- Decision context and strategic question
- Available options or alternatives
- Key stakeholders and their priorities
- Constraints and success criteria
- Risk tolerance and time horizon

## Task Execution Instructions

### 1. Decision Architecture Setup

- **Frame the Decision:**
  - Clearly articulate what decision needs to be made
  - Define success criteria and acceptable outcomes
  - Identify decision timeline and key milestones
  - Establish decision authority and approval process

- **Stakeholder Alignment:**
  - Map decision stakeholders and their interests
  - Understand different perspectives on success
  - Identify potential conflicts and areas of alignment
  - Establish communication and feedback processes

### 2. Options Generation & Refinement

- **Alternative Development:**
  - Generate comprehensive set of strategic options
  - Include "do nothing" as baseline option
  - Consider hybrid approaches and variations
  - Ensure options span meaningful strategic choices

- **Option Screening:**
  - Apply initial feasibility filters
  - Eliminate obviously inferior alternatives
  - Ensure remaining options are viable and distinct
  - Validate option completeness with stakeholders

### 3. Evaluation Criteria Framework

- **Criteria Identification:**
  - Financial impact (NPV, ROI, payback period)
  - Strategic fit (alignment with vision/goals)
  - Risk profile (probability of success, downside protection)
  - Implementation feasibility (resources, capabilities, timing)
  - Stakeholder impact (customer, employee, partner effects)

- **Criteria Weighting:**
  - Assign relative importance weights to each criterion
  - Use stakeholder input to validate weightings
  - Consider different weighting scenarios
  - Document rationale for weighting decisions

### 4. Quantitative Analysis

- **Financial Modeling:**
  - Build financial projections for each option
  - Include sensitivity analysis for key variables
  - Calculate risk-adjusted returns where appropriate
  - Model different scenarios (base, optimistic, pessimistic)

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Identify key risks for each option
  - Quantify probability and impact of major risks
  - Assess risk correlation and portfolio effects
  - Develop risk mitigation strategies

### 5. Trade-off Analysis

- **Multi-Criteria Evaluation:**
  - Score each option against all criteria
  - Apply weighting factors to calculate overall scores
  - Identify areas where options excel or fall short
  - Highlight significant trade-offs between options

- **Scenario Testing:**
  - Test option performance under different future scenarios
  - Assess robustness of options to uncertainty
  - Identify options that perform well across scenarios
  - Highlight options that are scenario-dependent

### 6. Decision Recommendation

- **Recommendation Development:**
  - Synthesize quantitative analysis with qualitative insights
  - Develop clear recommendation with supporting rationale
  - Address major counterarguments and concerns
  - Propose implementation approach and timeline

- **Decision Package:**
  - Executive summary with clear recommendation
  - Supporting analysis and key assumptions
  - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
  - Implementation plan and resource requirements
  - Success metrics and monitoring approach

## Output Deliverables

- **Decision Framework:** Structured approach with criteria and weightings
- **Options Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation of all alternatives
- **Financial Models:** Quantitative projections and sensitivity analysis
- **Risk Assessment:** Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- **Final Recommendation:** Clear recommendation with implementation plan

## Success Criteria

- All viable options are systematically evaluated
- Trade-offs are explicitly identified and quantified
- Recommendation is supported by rigorous analysis
- Stakeholders understand rationale and implications
- Decision process is transparent and defensible
- Implementation approach is realistic and detailed
