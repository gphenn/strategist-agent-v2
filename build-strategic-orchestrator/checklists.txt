# ACT Phase Completion Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that the ACT phase (Strategic Advisor + Strategic Innovator) has completed all essential work to transition from strategic planning to operational execution. This checklist ensures the strategic decision has been translated into a detailed, actionable, innovation-enriched implementation plan that guides organizational execution.

## What This Phase Accomplishes

The ACT phase operationalizes strategy. The Strategic Advisor and Innovator together ensure:
- Strategy is translated into executable plan
- Innovation opportunities are integrated

# ANALYSE Phase Completion Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that the ANALYSE phase (Strategic Analyst + Strategic Specialist) has completed all essential work before transitioning to the INSIGHT phase. This checklist ensures hypotheses have been systematically tested, data has been rigorously analyzed, and patterns have been identified that support strategic decision-making.

## What This Phase Accomplishes

The ANALYSE phase transforms hypotheses into evidence-based insights. The Analyst and Specialist together ensure:
- All key hypotheses are systematically tested
- Quantitative data supports findings
- Competitive landscape is understood
- Patterns and trends are identified
- Findings are documented with supporting evidence

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Hypothesis Testing Completion ✓

- [ ] **All priority hypotheses have been tested**
  - High-impact hypotheses: all tested
  - Medium-impact hypotheses: all tested
  - Quick-win hypotheses: tested (or explicitly deferred with reason)
  - At least 80% of hypotheses from SPLIT phase tested

- [ ] **Testing evidence is documented**
  - For each hypothesis: data/evidence gathered
  - Testing methodology documented
  - Sample sizes adequate (or limitations noted)
  - Data sources credible and traceable

- [ ] **Hypotheses validated or refuted**
  - Each hypothesis has clear conclusion: supported, refuted, or inconclusive
  - Strength of evidence assessed (strong, moderate, weak)
  - Confidence level in conclusion noted
  - Boundary conditions identified (when hypothesis holds true)

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Hypothesis:** "SMB customers churn due to pricing"
  - **Testing:** Exit interviews (15 customers), pricing analysis (vs. 5 competitors), market research
  - **Evidence:** 12/15 exit interviews cited price; we're 20-30% higher than closest competitor; market research confirms price sensitivity in SMB
  - **Conclusion:** **STRONGLY SUPPORTED** - price is primary driver for SMB churn
  - **Boundary:** Applies to SMB segment <100 employees; enterprise less price sensitive

- **Hypothesis:** "Product mobile experience drives enterprise churn"
  - **Testing:** Feature gap analysis, NPS by device type, customer interviews
  - **Evidence:** Mobile is 15% of usage; desktop-only features not major complaint; NPS similar across device types
  - **Conclusion:** **REFUTED** - not a primary churn driver; secondary concern
  - **Alternative Found:** Enterprise customers want advanced integrations (API quality)

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Statistical significance testing
- ❌ Peer-reviewed academic rigor
- ❌ Testing of tangential hypotheses
- ❌ Proof beyond reasonable doubt (strong evidence is enough)

   - Can we identify root causes vs. symptoms?

3. **Is the analysis actionable?**
   - Do findings point toward possible solutions?
   - Can we understand what to fix?
   - Are priorities clear?

4. **Do the Analyst and Specialist both feel the analysis is complete?**
   - Do they have confidence in findings?

```
COHERENCE CHECK:

VALUE PROPOSITION: Easy-to-use integration platform
CUSTOMER SEGMENT: Enterprise companies
Question: Do enterprise customers value "easy to use"?
Answer: Yes, but only if feature-rich. Easy-to-use AND powerful
required for enterprise. Does our positioning deliver both?
Assessment: YES - we're "easy compared to custom" but also feature-rich

REVENUE MODEL: $50K annual subscription for enterprise
Question: Is this price aligned with value?
Analysis: Customer ROI = save $200K+ annually on developer time
Value = 4-10x cost. Price is aligned with value.
Assessment: YES - pricing is defensible

COST STRUCTURE: 20% on customer support for enterprise
Question: Can we support enterprise customers profitably?
Analysis: Enterprise customers need high-touch support.
Support cost may need to be 20-25% for enterprise.
At $50K revenue, that's $10K support cost = acceptable.
Assessment: YES - margins still healthy even with high support cost

RESOURCES/ACTIVITIES: 90+ pre-built integrations
Question: Do we have resources to maintain this?
Analysis: 10-person engineering team.
Maintaining 90 integrations = significant ongoing work.
Is this sustainable? Only if integrations are high-demand
and customer success shows value (justifying investment).
Assessment: OKAY - but need to monitor resource drain

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Model is internally coherent.
All pieces support each other. No major contradictions.
Model is viable if execution meets plan.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect alignment across all elements
- ❌ Detailed financial validation
- ❌ Complete capability assessment
- ❌ Perfect logic (some tension OK if understood)

### 3. Business Model Logic Is Explicit ✓

- [ ] **How do elements interact explained**
  - How does each element support others?
  - Where are dependencies?
  - What's the cause-and-effect?
  - Is logic clear?

- [ ] **Customer value creation is visible**
  - How do customers benefit?
  - How does each element contribute?
  - What's the path from activities to customer value?
  - Would customer understand logic?

- [ ] **Competitive positioning is clear**
  - How is our model different?
  - What's hard to copy?
  - What's our defensible advantage?
  - How do we stay ahead?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
BUSINESS MODEL LOGIC:

CUSTOMER VALUE CREATION:
1. We identify what integrations customer needs (customer research)
2. We pre-build those integrations (key activity)
3. We provide simple UI to configure them (key activity)
4. Customer can sync data in hours, not months (value delivered)
5. Customer saves $200K+ on developer time (value monetized)
6. Customer pays $30K for solution (our revenue)

ELEMENT INTERACTIONS:
Customer Segments → Value Prop → Revenue Model
Enterprise needs powerful + easy = $50K price
SMB needs simple + affordable = $1K price
(Same product, different positioning, different pricing)

Resources → Activities → Value Prop
90+ integrations (resource) + easy UI (activity) = less developer work
Engineering team (resource) + continuous improvement (activity) = platform reliability
Sales team (resource) + enterprise motion (activity) = customer acquisition

Partnerships → Customer Relationships
Cloud partners (partnerships) enable reliability (customer relationship)
Integration partners (partnerships) enable ecosystem (customer value)
Reseller partners (partnerships) reach new segments (channels)

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING:
Hard to copy: 90+ pre-built integrations (took years to build)
Our advantage: Network effect (more integrations = more valuable)
Market position: "Most integrations" = competitive moat
Long-term: As we add integrations, we become harder to beat

COST STRUCTURE enables business model:
To maintain 90 integrations and support enterprise
We need 30% of revenue in product/engineering
That leaves 40% gross margin for other costs
At scale, model is profitable (gross margin > operating costs)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect cause-and-effect
- ❌ Detailed interdependency maps
- ❌ Mathematical modeling
- ❌ Complete competitive analysis

---

### 4. Model Is Realistic and Achievable ✓

- [ ] **Elements are realistic**
  - Can we actually build this?
  - Do partnerships exist/are feasible?
  - Can we acquire/retain talent?
  - Is market response likely?

- [ ] **Unit economics work**
  - Gross margin is healthy?
  - CAC payback is reasonable?
  - LTV is attractive?
  - Model scales profitably?

- [ ] **Key assumptions identified**
  - What must be true for model to work?
  - What are risky assumptions?
  - What would break the model?
  - How would we validate?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
REALISM CHECK:

Can we build 90 integrations?
Assessment: Yes, and we have. This is proven.

Can we maintain them as platforms change?
Assessment: Yes, with dedicated team. This is built into cost model.

Will customers pay $30K for SMB offering?
Assessment: Moderate confidence. SMB is price sensitive.
We'd need to prove value = 10x cost. Possible but not certain.

Will enterprise partnerships work?
Assessment: Yes. We have some partners already.
Path is clear.

UNIT ECONOMICS:

Customer: Enterprise
Revenue: $30K annual
Gross margin: 70% ($21K)
CAC: $5K (assume 3-6 month payback; healthy for enterprise SaaS)
LTV: $100K+ (3+ year relationship; high margin = strong value)
LTV:CAC: 20:1 (excellent)

Assessment: Unit economics are strong for enterprise

Customer: SMB
Revenue: $2K annual
Gross margin: 60% ($1.2K) - lower because less economies of scale
CAC: $500 (need to be efficient; possibly channel-based)
LTV: $8K (4 year relationship; best case)
LTV:CAC: 16:1 (good, but tighter than enterprise)

Assessment: Unit economics are acceptable for SMB if CAC can be controlled

KEY ASSUMPTIONS:

Assumption 1: Enterprise willing to pay $30K for pre-built integrations
Why: Saves developer time ($200K+ annual value)
Risk: If value not realized, price pressure
Mitigation: Customer success ensures value realization

Assumption 2: SMB willing to pay $2K for simplified solution
Why: Easy to use + key integrations = value
Risk: If SMB market is too price-sensitive, won't work
Mitigation: Validate willingness to pay before heavy investment

Assumption 3: We can maintain 90 integrations efficiently
Why: Built cost into model (20% of revenue)
Risk: If maintenance costs higher, margins compress
Mitigation: Monitor actual vs. planned; reduce integrations if needed

Assumption 4: Customers stick around (low churn)
Why: Switching costs and value stickiness
Risk: If churn higher than modeled, LTV drops
Mitigation: Monitor churn; improve customer success if needed
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect achievability assessment
- ❌ Complete market validation
- ❌ Detailed financial models
- ❌ Risk-free assumptions

---

### 5. Model Evolves Based on Market Learning ✓

- [ ] **Adaptation strategy is clear**
  - How will we know if model working?
  - When would we pivot?
  - What's the learning approach?
  - How do we stay flexible?

- [ ] **Contingencies identified**
  - If assumption 1 breaks, what do we do?
  - If assumption 2 breaks, what do we do?
  - Are there fallback positions?
  - Can we adjust model mid-course?

- [ ] **Scalability path is visible**
  - How does model scale with revenue?
  - Do unit economics improve at scale?
  - Are there scalability challenges?
  - How do we plan for scaling?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
EVOLUTION & LEARNING:

Measurement Approach:
Monthly: Track unit economics by customer segment
- CAC actual vs. plan
- LTV actual vs. plan
- Churn rate (overall and by segment)
- Customer satisfaction

Quarterly: Assess model assumptions
- Are customer segments behaving as expected?
- Is pricing right?
- Are partnerships working?
- Are activities supporting value prop?

Pivot Triggers:
IF SMB adoption is 50%+ slower than plan
AND financial projections miss by 25%+
THEN reassess SMB strategy (continue, pivot, or stop)

IF Enterprise churn rises above 10% (vs. 5% planned)
THEN investigate (product? support? competition?)
and adjust business model if needed

ADAPTATION OPTIONS:

If SMB market is less receptive than expected:
- Adjust pricing (lower to increase adoption)
- Simplify feature set further (reduce cost)
- Refocus on enterprise (proven segment)
- Pivot to adjacent segment (mid-market)

If integration maintenance is more expensive:
- Build API platform (let partners build integrations)
- Reduce number of integrations (focus on key ones)
- Adopt third-party integration marketplace
- Increase customer success cost and prices

SCALABILITY:

Current model (100 customers, $2M revenue):
- 30 engineers for product/integrations
- 10 customer success team
- 15 sales/marketing
- Gross margin: 65-70%
- Operating margin: Break-even to slight positive

Scaled model (1000 customers, $30M revenue):
- 50 engineers (not 300) due to automation/leverage
- 50 customer success (not 100) due to self-serve
- 50 sales/marketing (not 150) due to efficiency
- Gross margin: 70-75% (improve through scale)
- Operating margin: 30%+ (profitable at scale)

Assessment: Model scales well. Margins improve.
Not capital-intensive. Good unit economics at scale.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect contingency plans
- ❌ Detailed learning metrics
- ❌ Complete scalability modeling
- ❌ Predictive accuracy

  → EBITDA negative 5%

Year 2: 30% adoption; revenue up 15%; cost normalized
  → EBITDA improves to +12%

Year 3: 50% adoption; strong retention; revenue up 30%
  → EBITDA improves to +20%

Investment: $500K systems + transition
Payback: Year 2 (systems paid back; profitability improved)

---

Innovation: Platform Ecosystem Model

Revenue Scenario:
Year 1: Platform development; no ecosystem revenue
Year 2: 10 partners; $50K average revenue each = $500K platform revenue
Year 3: 30 partners; $100K average; platform revenue $3M
Year 5: 100 partners; $500K average; platform revenue $50M

Profitability Impact:
Year 1-2: Negative (major platform investment)
Year 3: Break-even on platform (development costs recovered)
Year 4+: Positive (ecosystem scales; cost stable)

Platform profitability:
Year 3: $3M revenue - $2M costs = $1M profit
Year 5: $50M revenue - $10M costs = $40M profit

Full company impact:
Year 1: Negative (platform investment)
Year 2: Slight negative (ecosystem building)
Year 3-5: Positive (accelerating)

Investment: $2-3M in platform development
Timeline: 24+ months to break-even
Risk: Ecosystem may not develop as planned

---

**What This Looks Like:**

```
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS:

IMPLICATION 1: Product Positioning Strategy

Insight: Competitor A dominates with comprehensive breadth; Competitor B
wins with simplicity. Gap: "Focused depth" is unclaimed.

Strategic Choice Options:

Option A: "Match Competitor A" (Comprehensive)
- Build all 15+ workflows
- Position as "Everything you need"
- Go head-to-head on breadth
- Trade-off: Requires $50M+ capital; long development time
- Recommendation: NOT RECOMMENDED (wrong capital, wrong timeline)

Option B: "Match Competitor B" (Simple)
- Build 6-8 core workflows only
- Position as "Demand planning, done right"
- Compete on ease of use and speed
- Trade-off: Limits market; customers want more features later
- Recommendation: POSSIBLE (but commoditizes us; low moat)

Option C: "Vertical Expertise" (RECOMMENDED)
- Build 8-10 workflows
- Optimize workflows for specific verticals (automotive, pharma, food)
- Position as "Built for [vertical]"
- Trade-off: Limits addressable market to 3 verticals initially
- Recommendation: YES (creates differentiation; builds defensibility)

Recommended Strategy: Option C (Vertical Expertise)
Why:
✓ Creates defensible positioning (not directly comparable to horizontals)
✓ Allows focused product development (not everything to everyone)
✓ Builds vertical brand and moat
✓ Enables vertical account teams (better customer fit)
✓ Can expand to adjacent verticals (scalable model)

IMPLICATION 2: Pricing Strategy

Insight: Price point signals positioning. Competitor A is premium ($40-120K);
Competitor B is mid-market ($25-75K). Gap: Can we be "premium within vertical"?

Strategic Choice Options:

Option A: "Undercut Competitor B" ($20-50K ACV)
- Position as "Great value"
- Win on price
- Trade-off: Signals "discount/lower quality"; attracts price-sensitive customers
- Recommendation: NOT RECOMMENDED (wrong message)

Option B: "Match Competitor B" ($25-75K ACV)
- Position as "Competitive pricing"
- Neutral positioning
- Trade-off: No pricing advantage; compete on features
- Recommendation: POSSIBLE (safe but not differentiating)

Option C: "Premium Within Vertical" ($50-100K ACV for vertical-specific)
- Position as "Vertical expertise commands premium pricing"
- Win on value, not price
- Trade-off: Requires strong vertical value prop; only works if customers see value
- Recommendation: YES (supports vertical positioning)

Recommended Strategy: Option C
Why:
✓ Aligns with vertical expertise positioning
✓ Supports premium perception ("vertical expert")
✓ Funds vertical product development
✓ Signals quality and focus (not cheap)
✓ Customers willing to pay for vertical optimization

Pricing Decision: $60-90K ACV to start (premium vs. horizontal; reasonable vs. Competitor A)

IMPLICATION 3: Sales/GTM Strategy

Insight: Sales model must match positioning. Horizontal competitors need big
sales teams. Vertical positioning can work with smaller, specialized team.

Strategic Choice Options:

Option A: "Enterprise Sales Machine" (50+ reps)
- Large sales team; geographic coverage
- Position as "Everywhere"
- Trade-off: Requires significant capital; harder to scale
- Recommendation: NOT RECOMMENDED (wrong capital model)

Option B: "Channel Partners" (resellers)
- Distribute through partners; light sales team
- Position as "Accessible"
- Trade-off: Lose customer relationship; lower margins; harder to control
- Recommendation: POSSIBLE (but loses direct relationships)

Option C: "Vertical Account Teams" (3-5 reps per vertical)
- Specialized sales teams for each vertical
- Build deep customer relationships in verticals
- Trade-off: Requires vertical expertise; slower to expand geographies
- Recommendation: YES (supports vertical positioning; builds moats)

Recommended Strategy: Option C
Why:
✓ Aligns with vertical expertise positioning
✓ Reps build deep vertical knowledge (better selling)
✓ Customers value specialized reps (understanding their business)
✓ Smaller team = lower capital requirement
✓ Foundation for vertical expansion

Sales Model: 3 vertical-specialized reps to start (automotive, pharma, food);
add reps as teams hit quota

IMPLICATION 4: Product Roadmap

Insight: Competition is moving on features (A adding more), AI (C emphasizing),
implementation speed (B winning). We need to be strategic about roadmap.

Year 1 Roadmap Implications:
- Priority 1: Core workflows (6) + vertical optimization (our differentiation)
- Priority 2: Fast implementation (beat B on speed)
- Priority 3: Basic ML (match C's positioning, but prove ours is better)
- Priority 4: Vertical-specific features (build moat in each vertical)
- Not priority: Matching A's breadth (not this year)

Resource Allocation:
- 60% to vertical optimization (our differentiation)
- 20% to fast implementation (customer expectation)
- 15% to ML/AI foundation (competitive positioning)
- 5% to adjacent features (roadmap for later expansion)

IMPLICATION 5: Brand & Messaging

Insight: Positioning must differentiate. "Vertical Expertise + Simplicity + Speed"
creates clear, unique brand.

Brand Positioning Statement:
"[Our company] is the supply chain optimization platform built specifically for
[vertical]. We combine deep vertical expertise with intuitive design and rapid
implementation to help [vertical] optimize their unique supply chain challenges.
Unlike horizontal platforms, we don't try to be everything to everyone. We're
focused on what matters most in [your vertical]."

Messaging Pillars:
1. Vertical Expertise (not horizontal generic)
2. Simplicity (not complex)
3. Speed (implementation and ROI)
4. Deep Understanding (vertical-specific features and workflows)

Competitive Positioning:
- vs. Competitor A: "Simpler + Faster + Focused" (not comprehensive)
- vs. Competitor B: "Deeper" (not just demand planning)
- vs. Competitor C: "Proven + Reliable" (not just innovative AI)

SUMMARY OF STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:

✓ Product: Vertical expertise (not horizontal breadth)
✓ Pricing: Premium ($60-90K) within verticals
✓ Sales: Specialized vertical teams (not large enterprise sales machine)
✓ Roadmap: Vertical optimization (not feature breadth)
✓ Brand: "Vertical expert + simple + fast"
✓ Differentiation: Not matched by competitors (defensible)

This creates coherent, differentiated strategy with defensible moat.

CUSTOMER VALIDATION:

Differentiation: Vertical Expertise in Automotive

Customer research findings:
- Interview 1 (Automotive Company A):
  "When evaluating solutions, we want something that understands
  automotive complexity (supply chains, just-in-time, recalls).
  Generic solutions miss our specific needs."
  → Importance: HIGH

- Interview 2 (Automotive Company B):
  "We spent 6 months customizing a generic tool. A purpose-built
  solution would have been faster and easier."
  → Importance: HIGH (time/money spent validating need)

- Interview 3 (Automotive Company C):
  "We'd pay a premium for something built for automotive.
  Our current solution doesn't understand our business."
  → Importance: HIGH (willingness to pay premium)

- Interview 4 (Non-automotive Company):
  "We want a solution that fits our industry, not automotive-focused."
  → Importance: Not valued outside vertical

Overall assessment: HIGH importance for automotive; lower outside

---

Differentiation: Implementation Speed (30 vs. 120 days)

Customer research findings:
- Interview 1 (VP Operations):
  "Time-to-value is critical. 120 days of implementation delays our ROI
  by 4 months. That's material to our business case."
  → Value: HIGH (blocks decision if too slow)

- Interview 2 (CFO):
  "If we can go live in 30 days, the ROI is 4x better. We'd definitely
  consider solutions with faster implementation."
  → Value: HIGH (affects financial decision)

- Interview 3 (IT Director):
  "Implementation complexity is our constraint. Simpler is better.
  Speed matters but only if quality doesn't suffer."
  → Value: MEDIUM (speed matters but quality required)

- Financial Impact Modeling:
  $1M annual savings benefit of going live 90 days faster
  → Value: Quantified ($1M/customer)

Overall assessment: HIGH value; would affect buying decision

---

VALUE PROPOSITION:

Vertical Expertise:
- Problem solved: Generic tools miss automotive complexity
- Customer benefit: Solution built for how we work
- Measurable value: 40% shorter implementation; higher adoption
- ROI: $500K in faster time-to-value per customer
- Why customer pays premium: Saves time and money; better fit

Implementation Speed:
- Problem solved: Long implementations delay ROI
- Customer benefit: Go live in 30 days; see ROI quickly
- Measurable value: $1M benefit from 90-day acceleration
- ROI: If cost is $100K, ROI is 10x in first year
- Why customer pays premium: Fast ROI; faster decision

Assessment: Both differentiation factors are valued; would drive decisions.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ All customers value differentiation equally
- ❌ Quantified value for every customer
- ❌ Formal market research study
- ❌ Unanimous customer endorsement

### 3. Differentiation Is Defensible ✓

- [ ] **Differentiation is hard to copy**
  - Can competitor replicate it easily?
  - What's the time to replicate?
  - What resources/capability required?
  - What would stop them?

- [ ] **Differentiation has barrier to entry**
  - Proprietary technology (patents)?
  - Unique data/expertise?
  - Scale advantages?
  - Network effects?

- [ ] **Differentiation creates switching costs**
  - Once customer chooses us, is it hard to switch?
  - Are there lock-in mechanisms?
  - How sticky is the differentiation?
  - Would customer stay if competitor matched?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
DEFENSIBILITY ASSESSMENT:

Differentiation: Vertical Expertise in Automotive

Can competitors replicate?
Timeline to replicate: 18-24 months
Why it takes time:
- Must hire automotive domain experts
- Must learn automotive workflows/compliance
- Must customize product for automotive needs
- Must build automotive customer references
- Must establish automotive sales credibility

Resources required to replicate:
- $2-3M to hire 3-4 automotive experts
- 12 months to develop automotive-specific product features
- 6 months to build reference customers
- Ongoing: Maintain vertical focus (opportunity cost for horizontal)

What stops competitors from copying:
- Opportunity cost (focus on automotive = less focus on other verticals)
- Capital required (expensive to build vertical expertise)
- Time required (18+ months is long)
- Expertise (not many people with automotive + software expertise)

Defensibility rating: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Replicable but takes time and capital
- First-mover advantage is valuable
- Over time, advantage could erode as competitor invests

Switching costs if we win automotive customer:
- Customer invested in understanding our vertical solution
- Retraining on competitor system would take time
- Loss of vertical-specific features
- Risk of lower adoption with generic solution
Switching cost: MEDIUM (not zero, but not permanent lock-in)

---

Differentiation: Implementation Speed (30 vs. 120 days)

Can competitors replicate?
Timeline to replicate: 3-6 months
Why it's faster:
- Simplification is product choice (can be changed quickly)
- Configuration/templates can be rebuilt (no new tech)
- Implementation process can be redesigned

Resources required:
- $500K to redesign implementation process
- 3 months to build templates and automation
- Small team can execute (not large investment)

What stops competitors:
- Low barrier = competitor can match quickly
- If competitor matches, differentiation is lost
- Ongoing: Must stay ahead on speed

Defensibility rating: LOW
- Easily replicable
- Quick to catch up
- Advantage is temporary (3-6 month window)

Switching costs:
- Once customer is live, customizations could be ported to competitor
- Main switching cost is disruption (go-live again)
- 30-day head start is advantage, but not permanent

Defensibility rating: LOW (short-term advantage; not long-term moat)

---

DEFENSIBILITY STRATEGY:

For Vertical Expertise (Medium-High Defensibility):
- Build 3-5 year lead before competitor can catch up
- Use 18-month window to establish market dominance
- Build switching costs through vertical integrations
- Create vertical brand (become "the automotive solution")
- Add new verticals after establishing leadership

For Implementation Speed (Low Defensibility):
- Use 3-6 month window to win customers
- Transition from speed to service excellence (stickier)
- Emphasize vertical expertise once product speed is matched
- Build customer success moat (not product moat)
- Continuous innovation to stay ahead

Overall defensibility: MEDIUM
- Vertical expertise provides medium-term moat
- Implementation speed provides short-term advantage
- Together they create reasonable competitive buffer

Risk: If competitor matches both (vertical + speed), differentiation erodes
Mitigation: Add additional differentiation layers (service, support, AI)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Permanent competitive advantage
- ❌ Impossible to copy
- ❌ Decades of defensibility
- ❌ Multiple layers of moat

### 5. Differentiation Strategy Anticipates Competition ✓

- [ ] **Competitor response is anticipated**
  - How might competitors respond?
  - What would they do to match us?
  - What's their timeline to respond?
  - What resources would they commit?

- [ ] **Response scenarios are planned**
  - If competitor matches our differentiation?
  - If competitor undercuts our pricing?
  - If competitor enters our vertical?
  - If competitor combines their strength with our weakness?

- [ ] **Contingency plans are ready**
  - What would we do if competitor matches?
  - How would we evolve differentiation?
  - What's the Plan B?
  - How do we stay ahead?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
COMPETITIVE RESPONSE SCENARIOS:

Scenario 1: Competitor A (Horizontal Leader) Tries to Match Vertical Expertise

Timeline: 18-24 months to build credible vertical offering
Their approach:
- Hire automotive domain experts (they have capital)
- Build automotive-specific features (they have engineering)
- Establish automotive partnerships (they have relationships)
- Launch "automotive edition" of their platform

Our advantage: 18-month head start
Our disadvantage: They have more capital and resources

Response options:
Option A: Deepen vertical expertise further
- Add more automotive-specific features they can't match
- Build stronger automotive partnerships (lock them up)
- Establish market dominance before they launch
- Timeline: Month 0-18, work intensely

Option B: Add new verticals
- Establish ourselves in pharma, food processing too
- Use automotive success as reference for other verticals
- Expand TAM beyond automotive
- Timeline: Month 12-24, start verticals 2+3

Option C: Add complementary differentiation
- While building vertical expertise, add implementation speed
- Add customer success excellence
- Add AI/ML for better predictions
- Build moat beyond vertical alone
- Timeline: Month 0-24, parallel tracks

Recommendation: Combine A + B + C
- Deepen automotive (defensive)
- Launch adjacent verticals (offensive growth)
- Add layers (implementation speed, service)
- Create multiple moats instead of single

---

Scenario 2: Competitor B (SMB Specialist) Undercuts Our Price

Timeline: Immediate (they can change pricing anytime)
Their approach:
- Match vertical positioning (same target)
- Undercut price ($40-50K vs. our $60-80K)
- Position as "better value"

Our advantage: Established position; customer relationships
Our disadvantage: Losing pricing power; margin pressure

Response options:
Option A: Don't match price; stay premium
- Lean into differentiation ("you get what you pay for")
- Emphasize vertical expertise; customer success
- Target premium segment (willing to pay for best)
- Accept lower volume; higher margins
- Risky if customers price-sensitive

Option B: Match price; compete on service
- Keep pricing competitive but emphasize service
- Win on customer success, support, implementation
- Higher volume; lower margin
- Leverage vertical expertise in service delivery
- Risky if cost structure can't support it

Option C: Differentiate through service/outcomes
- Offer outcome-based pricing (pay for savings achieved)
- Shift from product to service differentiation
- Higher switching cost (lock in through outcomes)
- New business model; risky but defensible
- Requires different economics

Recommendation: Option A (don't match price)
- Differentiation justifies premium
- Service-driven moat (deeper than price)
- Better long-term strategy

---

Scenario 3: Competitor C (Emerging AI Specialist) Launches in Automotive

Timeline: 6-12 months to launch automotive-focused AI solution
Their approach:
- Use AI/ML as key differentiation (vs. rules-based)
- Target automotive with "AI-powered" positioning
- Position as "next-gen automation"

Our advantage: First-mover; established relationships
Our disadvantage: AI not our primary differentiator yet

Response options:
Option A: Add AI/ML to our offering
- Develop AI-powered features (forecasting, optimization)
- Emphasize that AI + vertical expertise = superior
- Catch up on technology; lean on domain expertise
- Timeline: 12-18 months to build credible AI
- Risk: May be too slow; they establish AI lead

Option B: Emphasize vertical expertise + implementation speed
- Lean into what we're best at (not try to copy them)
- Position as "proven, reliable, purpose-built"
- Avoid AI arms race
- Risk: Ceding AI technology leadership

Option C: Partner with AI specialist
- Partner rather than build (faster to market)
- Combine their AI with our vertical expertise
- "Best of both worlds" positioning
- Benefit: Quick response; complementary strengths
- Risk: Less control; shared profit

Recommendation: Option C (partnership)
- Fastest response to threat
- Combines complementary strengths
- Preserves capital for other initiatives

---

OVERALL COMPETITIVE STRATEGY:

Defensive (Protect position):
- Build automotive dominance before competitors enter
- Establish switching costs (vertical expertise, relationships)
- Move fast; don't wait

Offensive (Extend advantage):
- Launch adjacent verticals while defending automotive
- Add complementary differentiation (speed, service, AI)
- Build multiple moats, not single-point moat

Adaptive (Respond to threats):
- Monitor competitor moves closely
- Anticipate responses (what would we do?)
- Have contingency plans ready
- Stay ahead through continuous evolution

Assessment: Strategy addresses competitive threats; plans are ready.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect predictions of competitor behavior
- ❌ Plans for every possible scenario
- ❌ Ability to prevent all competitive response
- ❌ Permanent competitive dominance

1. **Are the options truly strategic choices?**
   - Do they represent meaningfully different directions?
   - Would different stakeholders prefer different options?
   - Is there real trade-off tension between them?
   - Would decision matter significantly to business?

2. **Is the recommendation well-founded?**
   - Would reasonable people understand the logic?
   - Is recommendation defensible against alternatives?
   - What would have to be true for different recommendation?
   - Is confidence level appropriate to decision importance?

3. **Have we addressed key decision concerns?**
   - Would executives understand the options?
   - Would they see the trade-offs clearly?
   - Would they feel confident in recommendation?
   - Would they feel heard and understood?

4. **Is implementation approach realistic?**
   - Would organization be capable of executing?
   - Are resource requirements reasonable?
   - Is timeline realistic?
   - Are contingencies thoughtful?

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready to Proceed to ACT When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Strategic options are fully defined and distinct
- Trade-offs are explicitly analyzed
- Risks are assessed with mitigation approaches
- Financial case is compelling
- Decision framework is applied
- Recommendation is clear and defensible
- Implementation foundations are sketched
- Documentation is complete and handed off

**The Innovator will have clear strategic direction to plan compelling implementation.**

---

### 🔄 Needs More Work When

One or more blocking criteria are unmet:

- **Options not distinct enough?**
  - → Define truly different strategic choices
  - → Ensure options represent trade-off tension
  - → Clarify what each option means

- **Trade-offs unclear?**
  - → For each option, articulate gains and losses
  - → Compare trade-offs across options
  - → Connect to strategic priorities

- **Risk assessment incomplete?**
  - → Identify critical risks for each option
  - → Assess probability and impact
  - → Outline mitigation approaches
  - → Document residual risk

- **Recommendation weak?**
  - → Apply clear decision framework
  - → Show why recommended option is superior
  - → Acknowledge trade-offs being accepted

**What This Looks Like:**

```
RISK MANAGEMENT:

Risk 1: Product Development Timeline Slips

Risk: Development takes longer than 6 months

Mitigation:
- Hire experienced VP Product (knows how to execute fast)
- Reduce scope to must-haves only
- Weekly milestone tracking
- Resource contingency built in

Detection:
- Monthly milestone reviews (Is product on track?)
- If 2+ weeks behind, escalate
- Trigger: Month 4 milestone slipped

Response:
- Reduce scope further (cut lower-priority features)
- Add resources if available
- Delay launch 2-4 weeks (manage expectations)
- Descope 2-3 features to stay close to timeline

Residual risk: Acceptable (could live with Month 8 launch)

---

Risk 2: Pilot Customers Don't Adopt/Churn

Risk: Pilots show low satisfaction (NPS <40) or churn

Mitigation:
- Carefully select pilot customers (strong fit)
- Dedicated support during pilot
- Weekly check-ins with pilots
- Rapid iteration based on feedback

Detection:
- Monthly pilot satisfaction tracking
- NPS target Month 8: 50+
- If NPS <40, pause additional pilots

Response:
- Pause new customer acquisitions
- Focus on pilot customer success
- Product refinement based on feedback
- 4-week re-engagement effort
- If still <40 NPS after refinement, reconsider market fit

Residual risk: Acceptable (market could be wrong; would pivot)

---

Risk 3: Key Talent Leaves

Risk: VP Product or key engineer departs mid-project

Mitigation:
- Competitive compensation (top-of-market pay)
- Clear equity/incentives for retention
- Strong vision/mission (people motivated)
- Succession plan in place

Detection:
- Regular 1:1s with key people
- Manager check-ins on engagement
- Pulse surveys quarterly

Response:
- Emergency backfill (recruitment)
- Interim coverage (other team members)
- Compressed timeline (if necessary)
- Scope adjustment (if necessary)

Residual risk: Manageable (could impact timeline; not fatal)

---

Risk 4: Faster Competitor Response

Risk: Competitor launches SMB product Month 8 (before us)

Mitigation:
- Move fast (hit Month 10 launch target)
- Differentiate via vertical expertise
- Build customer relationships early (pilots become advocates)
- Lock in early customers (incentivize commitment)

Detection:
- Weekly competitive intelligence
- If competitor announces, assess threat
- Re-evaluate positioning if needed

Response:
- Accelerate differentiation (enhance vertical focus)
- Emphasize customer success (switching cost)
- Consider partnership/acquisition (if strategic fit)

Residual risk: Acceptable (18-month lead is still defensible)
```

- ❌ Exhaustive risk list
- ❌ Perfect risk mitigation
- ❌ Zero contingency
- ❌ Risk-free execution

  - Does each phase have detailed plan?
  - Are activities broken down?
  - Are dependencies clear?

- [ ] **Change management approach**
  - How will we handle scope changes?
  - What's the approval process?
  - How will we manage expectations?

- [ ] **Dependency management**
  - Are external dependencies clear?
  - Supplier dependencies?
  - Customer dependencies?

- [ ] **Success criteria at each phase**
  - Phase 1: How do we know it was successful?
  - Phase 2: Same
  - Phase 3-5: Same

---

## Quality Checks (Before Approving)

Before confirming plan is complete, ask yourself:

1. **Is plan understandable?**
   - Could someone execute from this plan?
   - Are tasks and dependencies clear?
   - Would execution team know what to do?

2. **Is plan realistic?**
   - Are estimates reasonable?
   - Is timeline credible?
   - Is team sized right?
   - Are risks acknowledged?

3. **Does plan align with strategy?**
   - Are plan objectives aligned with decision?
   - Does execution serve the goal?
   - Would success achieve the outcome?

4. **Are we ready to execute?**
   - Are resources committed?
   - Is budget approved?
   - Is team in place?
   - Are we ready to start?

---

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Plan is Ready When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Clear objectives and success criteria

- **Sequence confusing?** → Map dependencies; clarify sequence
- **Ownership missing?** → Assign clear owners
- **Budget unclear?** → Estimate resources; allocate budget
- **Risks ignored?** → Identify and plan mitigation
- **No governance?** → Define decision and communication process

---

## Post-Validation Actions

Once this checklist passes:

1. **Get Executive Approval**

  - What are we assuming about costs?
  - What are we assuming about growth?
  - What are we assuming about operations?

- [ ] **Assumptions are realistic**
  - Are they based on data?

  - How sensitive is model to each key variable?
  - What would we need to be wrong about?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
KEY ASSUMPTIONS:

MARKET ASSUMPTIONS:
- SMB market size: $2B (validated by market research)
- Market growth rate: 25% annually (benchmarked to industry)
- Our market capture: 2% by Year 3 (based on competitive positioning)
- Basis: Conservative relative to TAM; market research suggests 3-4%

CUSTOMER ASSUMPTIONS:
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $5K (based on sales team estimates)
- Basis: SMB AE handles 3-4 deals/month at $15K avg deal; ~$5K CAC
- Confidence: MODERATE (varies by channel; average across channels)

- Customer lifetime value (LTV): $60K (3 year relationship, $20K/year)
- Basis: Pilot customer data; enterprise customers similar profile
- Confidence: MODERATE (SMB retention may differ; need validation)

- CAC payback period: 18 months (acceptable for SaaS)
- Basis: Industry standard; our enterprise is 12 months
- Confidence: MODERATE (higher than enterprise due to SMB support needs)

COST ASSUMPTIONS:
- Team ramp: 5 people Year 1; 10 by Year 2; 15 by Year 3
- Cost per person: $150K average (blended salary + benefits)
- Basis: Our current team costs; adjusted for SMB roles
- Confidence: HIGH (comparable to enterprise team)

- Gross margin: 75% (platform business model)
- COGS: 25% (cloud infrastructure, payment processing, support)
- Basis: Enterprise gross margin is 78%; assumes SMB slightly lower
- Confidence: MODERATE (depends on support model; could be 70-80%)

SENSITIVITY:
Top 3 variables with most impact on profitability:
1. Customer acquisition cost (±$2K = ±$3M 3-year impact)
2. Market capture rate (±0.5% = ±$5M 3-year impact)
3. Gross margin (±5% = ±$2M 3-year impact)

If CAC is $7K instead of $5K: Payback extends to 24 months (less attractive)
If market capture is 1% instead of 2%: Revenue cut in half
If gross margin is 70% instead of 75%: Profitability delayed 6 months
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Assumptions for every line item
- ❌ Perfect validation
- ❌ Exhaustive sensitivity analysis
- ❌ Academic-level rigor

### 3. Calculations Are Correct & Transparent ✓

- [ ] **Model calculations are correct**
  - Are formulas correct?
  - Are units consistent (dollars, customers, months)?
  - Do calculations flow logically?
  - Can someone trace a calculation from input to output?

- [ ] **Calculation methodology is documented**
  - How is revenue calculated?
  - How are costs calculated?
  - How are key metrics derived?
  - Would someone understand the logic?

- [ ] **Model has been validated**
  - Have calculations been spot-checked?
  - Have formulas been reviewed?
  - Are outputs reasonable?
  - Would finance team review this?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
REVENUE CALCULATION:
Year 1 Revenue = New Customers in Year 1 × Avg Annual Price + Renewal Revenue
New Customers Year 1 = 50 customers (ramp from 0 to 50 over year)
Avg Annual Price = $20K
Year 1 Revenue = (50 × $20K) + $0 (no renewals yet) = $1M

GROSS MARGIN CALCULATION:
Year 1 Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
Year 1 COGS = Revenue × 25% (cloud, payment processing, support)
Year 1 COGS = $1M × 25% = $250K
Year 1 Gross Profit = $1M - $250K = $750K
Year 1 Gross Margin = $750K / $1M = 75%

OPERATING EXPENSE CALCULATION:
Year 1 OpEx = Team costs + Marketing + Sales + G&A
Team costs: 5 people × $150K = $750K
Marketing: $250K (customer acquisition campaigns)
Sales (covered in team): Included above
G&A: $100K (shared services)
Total Year 1 OpEx = $750K + $250K + $100K = $1.1M

EBITDA CALCULATION:
Year 1 EBITDA = Gross Profit - OpEx = $750K - $1.1M = -$350K (loss in Year 1)

CAC PAYBACK CALCULATION:
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing / New Customers
CAC = $400K / 50 customers = $8K per customer (closer to $8K than $5K assumed)
LTV = Gross Margin per Customer × Customer Lifetime
LTV = ($20K × 75%) × 3 years = $45K
CAC Payback = CAC / (Monthly Gross Profit per Customer)
CAC Payback = $8K / ($1,250/mo) = 6.4 months (good payback)

VALIDATION CHECKS:
✓ Units are consistent (dollars, customers, years)
✓ Formulas calculate correctly
✓ Revenue logic makes sense (customer count × price)
✓ Cost logic makes sense (team + marketing + overhead)
✓ CAC payback is reasonable for SaaS
✓ Profitability trajectory is realistic (loss Year 1, breakeven Year 2, profit Year 3)
```

**What This Looks Like:**
```
BASE CASE (Most Likely - 60% probability):
Year 1: 50 customers, $1M revenue, -$350K EBITDA
Year 2: 150 customers, $3M revenue, +$200K EBITDA, breakeven reached
Year 3: 250 customers, $5M revenue, +$900K EBITDA, profitable
3-Year Total: $9M revenue, $1.75M gross profit, $750K net EBITDA

Key assumptions: CAC $8K, LTV $45K, 75% margin, 6.4 month payback
Confidence: MODERATE (customer acquisition is key variable)

UPSIDE CASE (Optimistic - 20% probability):
Assumption changes: Better unit economics (CAC $5K, LTV $60K)
Year 1: 75 customers, $1.5M revenue, -$150K EBITDA
Year 2: 225 customers, $4.5M revenue, +$500K EBITDA, breakeven earlier
Year 3: 350 customers, $7M revenue, +$1.5M EBITDA, strong profitability
3-Year Total: $13M revenue, $2.6M gross profit, $1.85M net EBITDA

Scenario: Strong SMB adoption, efficient sales, higher retention
Impact: Revenue 44% higher; profitability achieved faster
Decision impact: Makes SMB investment even more attractive

DOWNSIDE CASE (Conservative - 20% probability):
Assumption changes: Tougher economics (CAC $10K, LTV $40K)
Year 1: 25 customers, $500K revenue, -$550K EBITDA
Year 2: 75 customers, $1.5M revenue, -$100K EBITDA, still losing
Year 3: 150 customers, $3M revenue, +$200K EBITDA, breakeven delayed
3-Year Total: $5M revenue, $1.25M gross profit, -$450K net EBITDA

Scenario: Slower adoption, higher customer acquisition cost
Impact: Revenue 45% lower; profitability delayed to Year 3
Decision impact: Still reaches breakeven by Year 3; acceptable risk

SCENARIO SUMMARY:
                  Base Case    Upside       Downside
Year 1 Revenue    $1.0M        $1.5M        $0.5M

**What This Looks Like:**

```
FINANCIAL MODEL STRUCTURE:

SECTION 1: REVENUE PROJECTION (5-year)
Inputs (assumptions):
- Starting ACV: $50K
- Annual customer acquisition: Year 1=3; Year 2=8; Year 3=15; etc.
- Annual churn rate: 0% Years 1-2; 5% Years 3-5
- ACV growth: 5% annually (land and expand)

Calculations:
Year 1:
- New customers: 3
- Starting customers: 0
- Churned customers: 0
- Ending customers: 3
- Average ACV (conservative): $45K (weighted by acquisition timing)
- Annual recurring revenue: 3 × $45K = $135K

Year 2:
- Starting customers: 3
- New customers: 8
- Churned customers: 0.15 (5% × 3, assume mid-year)
- Ending customers: 10.85 ≈ 11
- Average ACV: $47K (2-year average; growth on new + existing)
- ARR: 11 × $47K = $517K

Year 3:
- Starting customers: 11
- New customers: 15
- Churned customers: 0.55 (5% × 11)
- Ending customers: 25.45 ≈ 25
- Average ACV: $49K
- ARR: 25 × $49K = $1.225M

Year 4-5: Similar logic

OUTPUT: 5-year revenue projection ($135K → $5.2M)

SECTION 2: COST PROJECTION (5-year)
Inputs (assumptions):
- COGS: 20% of revenue (support, hosting)
- Sales & Marketing: $2.5M Year 1; 40% of revenue Year 2+
- Product dev: 35% of revenue
- G&A: $500K Year 1; 12% of revenue Year 2+
- Headcount: Starting 8 (including founders); growing to 45 by Year 5

Calculations:
Year 1:
- Gross profit: $135K revenue - 20% COGS ($27K) = $108K
- Gross margin: 80%
- OpEx: Sales/Mkt ($2.5M) + Product ($47K) + G&A ($500K) = $3.047M
- EBITDA: $108K - $3.047M = -$2.939M
- Headcount: 8

Year 2:
- Gross profit: $517K - 20% ($103K) = $414K
- Gross margin: 80%
- OpEx: 40% sales/mkt ($207K) + 35% product ($181K) + 12% G&A ($62K) = $450K
- EBITDA: $414K - $450K = -$36K (near breakeven)
- Headcount: 12

Year 3:
- Gross profit: $1.225M - 20% ($245K) = $980K
- Gross margin: 80%
- OpEx: 40% sales/mkt ($490K) + 35% product ($429K) + 12% G&A ($147K) = $1.066M
- EBITDA: $980K - $1.066M = -$86K (near breakeven)
- Headcount: 18

Year 4:
- Revenue: $3.1M
- EBITDA: $300K (profitable!)

Year 5:
- Revenue: $5.2M
- EBITDA: $900K

OUTPUT: 5-year cost structure and profitability path

SECTION 3: CASH FLOW PROJECTION
Inputs (assumptions):
- Upfront capital: $3M
- Customer collection: Net 30 (assume monthly)
- Capital expenditure: Minimal (SaaS model)
- Payroll timing: Monthly, consistent
- Quarterly board/investor payouts: None until profitable

Calculations:
Year 1:
- Beginning cash: $3M
- Operating cash flow: -$2.939M (EBITDA from above)
- CapEx: $0 (minimal for SaaS)
- Financing: $0 (no additional raise assumed in base case)
- Ending cash: $3M - $2.939M = $61K
- Cash runway: Tight (need contingency capital)

Year 2:
- Beginning cash: $61K
- Operating cash flow: -$36K (near breakeven helps)
- Ending cash: $25K
- Cash runway: Very tight (contingency needed)

Year 3:
- Beginning cash: $25K
- Operating cash flow: -$86K (not yet profitable)
- Issues: Negative cash flow continues; will need additional capital or faster ramp

RECOMMENDATION: Model shows need for $3.5M capital (not just $3M) for 18-month runway to profitable growth.

MODEL VERIFICATION:
Spot checks:
✓ Year 1 revenue: 3 customers × $50K = $150K (within 10% of modeled $135K; difference is timing)
✓ Year 2 COGS: $517K × 20% = $103K ✓
✓ Year 2 OpEx: Correctly calculated
✓ Cash flow: Consistent with EBITDA

Testing:
✓ Circular references: None identified
✓ Formulas: Spot-checked 5+ cells; all correct
✓ Sources: Assumptions clearly linked to revenue/cost tabs
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect spreadsheet polish
- ❌ Peer review (though valuable)
- ❌ Formal audit
- ❌ Multi-page documentation

### 3. Key Financial Metrics Are Calculated ✓

- [ ] **Profitability metrics are clear**
  - When does business become profitable?
  - What's the path to profitability?
  - What's the margin structure?
  - How does profitability compare to benchmarks?

- [ ] **Cash flow metrics are calculated**
  - When do we run out of cash?
  - What's the cash burn rate?
  - When is payback period?
  - How much capital is needed?

- [ ] **Unit economics are modeled**
  - Customer acquisition cost (CAC)?
  - Customer lifetime value (LTV)?
  - LTV:CAC ratio (rule of thumb: >3:1)?
  - Payback period (rule of thumb: <12 months)?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
KEY FINANCIAL METRICS:

PROFITABILITY:

Gross Margin: 80% (consistent Years 1-5)
- Industry benchmark: 75-85% for SaaS
- Our model: On target

Operating Margin by Year:
- Year 1: -2900% (heavy investment phase)
- Year 2: -7% (near breakeven)
- Year 3: -7% (still investing)
- Year 4: 10% (profitable!)
- Year 5: 17% (maturing)
- Trajectory: Reasonable for SaaS company

Payback Period: ~36 months (3 years)
- Year 1-2: Building product and sales
- Year 3: Near breakeven
- Year 4: Profitable; recovering initial investment
- Benchmark: SaaS payback often 2-4 years
- Assessment: Reasonable; slightly long but acceptable given market entry risk

---

CASH FLOW:

Monthly Burn Rate (Year 1):
- Total spending: $3.047M ÷ 12 = $254K/month
- Revenue: Minimal initially
- Net burn: ~$250K/month
- Runway with $3M: 12 months (need extend to 18)

Cash Runway:
- Starting capital: $3M
- Monthly burn: $250K (declining over year)
- Additional capital needed: $500K - $1M for contingency
- Recommendation: Raise $3.5M (not just $3M)

Payback of Initial Investment:
- Initial investment: $3M
- Cumulative EBITDA recovery:
  Year 1: -$2.9M (behind by $2.9M)
  Year 2: -$2.9M - $36K = -$2.936M (still underwater)
  Year 3: -$2.936M - $86K = -$3.022M (worse!)
  Year 4: -$3.022M + $300K = -$2.722M (recovering)
  Year 5: -$2.722M + $900K = -$1.822M

Payback analysis: Not achieved by Year 5 in base case
Issues: Model shows investment not fully recovered by Year 5
This suggests either:
1. Model is too conservative (likely)
2. Growth needs to accelerate
3. Additional capital beyond $3M will be needed
4. Exit strategy (acquisition) needed for returns

---

UNIT ECONOMICS:

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
Year 1:
- Sales & Marketing spend: $2.5M
- Customers acquired: 3
- CAC: $2.5M ÷ 3 = $833K per customer
- This is HIGH (bloated by fixed costs; Year 1 is inefficient)

Year 2:
- Sales & Marketing spend: $207K
- Customers acquired: 8
- CAC: $207K ÷ 8 = $26K per customer
- More realistic (sales team now productive)

Year 3-5:
- CAC stabilizes around $20-30K per customer
- Benchmark: For $50K ACV, CAC of $20-30K is reasonable (LTV:CAC ≈ 3:1)

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):
Assumptions:
- Average customer lifetime: 7 years (1 ÷ 5% churn)
- Annual ACV: Grows 5% per year over lifetime
- Year 1 customer: $50K
- Year 2 customer: $52.5K average over lifetime
- Gross margin: 80% (what we keep)

Calculation:
Year 1 customer LTV:
- Year 1: $50K × 80% = $40K
- Year 2: $50K × 1.05 × 80% = $42K
- Year 3-7: Similar growth
- Total LTV: ~$330K (rough estimate)

LTV:CAC Ratio (Year 2 forward):
- LTV: $330K
- CAC: $25K (average)
- Ratio: 330 ÷ 25 = 13:1
- Benchmark: >3:1 is healthy; we're at 13:1 (excellent)
- Implication: Strong unit economics; customers are very profitable

CAC Payback Period:
- Annual ACV: $50K (Year 1 customer)
- Annual gross profit: $50K × 80% = $40K
- CAC: $25K (amortized Year 2+)
- Payback: $25K ÷ $40K = 0.625 years ≈ 7.5 months
- Benchmark: <12 months is good; we're at 7.5 months (excellent)

### 4. Scenarios Are Modeled (Best/Base/Worst) ✓

- [ ] **Best case scenario is defined**
  - What assumptions change in best case?
  - What's the upside outcome?
  - Is best case realistic (not fantasy)?
  - What's the revenue/profitability outcome?

- [ ] **Base case scenario is the core model**
  - This is the most likely scenario
  - Uses realistic assumptions
  - Is the foundation for planning
  - Profitability timeline clear

- [ ] **Worst case scenario is modeled**
  - What's the downside risk?
  - What assumptions change in worst case?
  - Could business survive worst case?
  - What's the minimum acceptable outcome?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
SCENARIO MODELING:

BASE CASE (Most Likely):
Revenue assumptions:
- Year 1 ACV: $50K (5% annual growth)
- Year 1 customers: 3 (ramps to 40 by Year 5)
- Churn: 5% by Year 3

Profitability:
- Profitable Year 4
- Year 5 revenue: $5.2M; EBITDA: $900K

Capital needed: $3.5M
Assessment: Realistic; supported by benchmarks

---

BEST CASE (Optimistic but Possible):
What changes:
- Product-market fit faster: 6 customers Year 1 (vs. 3)
- ACV higher due to faster land-and-expand: $60K Year 1 (vs. $50K)
- Churn lower (great product): 3% by Year 3 (vs. 5%)
- Marketing efficiency higher: 35% of revenue (vs. 40%)

Revenue impact:
- Year 1: 6 × $55K = $330K (vs. $135K base; 2.4x)
- Year 2: 18 customers × $57K = $1.03M (vs. $517K base; 2x)
- Year 5: 80+ customers × $65K = $5.2M → $7M+ (35% higher)

Profitability:
- Profitable Year 3 (vs. Year 4 in base)
- Year 5 EBITDA: $1.3M (vs. $900K base)
- IRR: Much higher; payback Year 3

Capital needed: $2.5M (vs. $3.5M base; can stretch further)

Likelihood: 25% (requires strong execution + favorable market)

---

WORST CASE (Challenging but Survivable):
What changes:
- Slower market adoption: 1 customer Year 1 (vs. 3)
- ACV lower due to price pressure: $40K Year 1 (vs. $50K)
- Churn higher (competitive pressure): 8% by Year 3 (vs. 5%)
- Marketing inefficiency: 50% of revenue (vs. 40%)
- Takes 2 years to achieve product-market fit (vs. Year 1)

Revenue impact:
- Year 1: 1 × $40K = $40K (vs. $135K base; 30%)
- Year 2: 3 customers × $41K = $123K (vs. $517K base; 24%)
- Year 3: 5 customers × $42K = $210K (vs. $1.225M base; 17%)
- Year 5: 15 customers × $45K = $675K (vs. $5.2M base; 13%)

Profitability:
- Not profitable in 5-year window
- Year 5 EBITDA: -$200K (still losing money)
- IRR: Negative; capital lost

Capital needed: $5M+ (longer burn; may not be fundable)
Issues: Business case doesn't work in worst case

Likelihood: 25% (possible if market rejects offering)

SCENARIO COMPARISON TABLE:

Metric                | Worst Case | Base Case | Best Case
Year 1 Revenue        | $40K       | $135K    | $330K
Year 3 Revenue        | $210K      | $1.225M  | $2.8M
Year 5 Revenue        | $675K      | $5.2M    | $7M+
Profitable?           | No         | Yes (Yr4)| Yes (Yr3)
Year 5 EBITDA         | -$200K     | $900K    | $1.3M
Capital needed        | $5M+       | $3.5M    | $2.5M
IRR (5 years)         | Negative   | 15-20%   | 35%+
Assessment            | RISKY      | VIABLE   | STRONG

---

RECOMMENDATION:

Base case is realistic and supported by data.
Best case is achievable with strong execution.
Worst case shows risk; requires contingency planning.

If worst case occurs:
- Option A: Pivot to adjacent market
- Option B: Sell company to strategic buyer
- Option C: Wind down; return remaining capital

Recommendation: Proceed with $3.5M capital; plan for best case; prepare for worst case.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Equal weight to all scenarios
- ❌ Detailed scenario documentation

- [ ] **Sensitivity to key assumptions is shown**
  - How sensitive is profitability to revenue growth?
  - How sensitive is profitability to costs?
  - What's the biggest profit driver?
  - What's the biggest risk?

- [ ] **Sensitivity is quantified**
  - Show tables or charts of sensitivity
  - Range: What if assumption ±10%, ±20%, ±50%?

  - Can we de-risk them?
  - What's the contingency?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:

Sensitivity to Revenue Growth (Year 1 Customer Acquisition):

What changes: Number of customers acquired Year 1
Current assumption: 3 customers

Sensitivity table:
Customers Acquired | Year 1 Revenue | Year 5 Revenue | Profitable?
1                  | $45K          | $675K         | NO
2                  | $90K          | $1.3M         | NO (Year 5+)
3 (Base)           | $135K         | $5.2M         | YES (Year 4)
4                  | $180K         | $6.8M         | YES (Year 3)
5                  | $225K         | $8.5M         | YES (Year 3)

Impact assessment:
- Each additional customer in Year 1 adds $45K to Year 1 revenue
- Each additional customer accelerates profitability by 6 months
- Most sensitive to initial customer acquisition (biggest driver)

---

Sensitivity to ACV (Average Customer Value):

What changes: Price per customer annually
Current assumption: $50K ACV

Sensitivity table:
ACV              | Year 5 Revenue | Year 4 EBITDA | Year 5 EBITDA
$40K (Low)       | $4.2M         | $200K        | $720K
$45K             | $4.7M         | $240K        | $810K
$50K (Base)      | $5.2M         | $300K        | $900K
$55K             | $5.7M         | $360K        | $990K
$60K (High)      | $6.2M         | $420K        | $1.08M

Impact assessment:
- 10% change in ACV = 10% change in revenue (linear)
- 10% ACV increase = $100K+ incremental profit Year 5
- Moderate sensitivity (less critical than customer count)

---

Sensitivity to COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):

What changes: Support costs and hosting (% of revenue)
Current assumption: 20% of revenue

Sensitivity table:
COGS %           | Gross Margin | Year 5 EBITDA | Impact on Profitability
15% (Efficient)  | 85%          | $980K        | 9% improvement
20% (Base)       | 80%          | $900K        | —
25% (Inefficient)| 75%          | $820K        | 9% decline
30% (Very High)  | 70%          | $740K        | 18% decline

Impact assessment:
- Each 1% improvement in COGS = $50K+ profit improvement
- Important to monitor (scalability of support)
- Lower sensitivity than revenue growth

---

Sensitivity to Sales & Marketing Spend:

What changes: Efficiency of sales and marketing (% of revenue)
Current assumption: 40% of revenue Year 2+

Sensitivity table:
S&M % of Revenue | Year 4 Profitable? | Year 5 EBITDA | Growth Rate
30% (Very Efficient) | YES         | $1.15M       | Constrained
35% (Efficient)      | YES         | $1.02M       | Normal
40% (Base)           | YES         | $900K        | Normal
50% (Inefficient)    | NO          | $680K        | High growth
60% (Very Inefficient)| NO         | $460K        | Very high growth

Impact assessment:
- Most efficient (30%) requires very selective customer acquisition
- Base case (40%) is industry standard; achievable
- If S&M efficiency declines, profitability at risk
- Trade-off: More S&M = faster growth but lower margins

---

KEY DRIVERS SUMMARY (Ranked by Sensitivity):

Rank 1: Customer Acquisition (Year 1-2)
- Impact: 100% sensitivity (each customer adds ~$45K revenue)
- Focus: Most important driver; must nail this
- Implication: De-risk through customer validation early

Rank 2: ACV (Price Point)
- Impact: Linear sensitivity (10% change = 10% profit change)
- Focus: Important but secondary
- Implication: Get pricing right; but customer count more critical

Rank 3: COGS Efficiency
- Impact: Medium sensitivity (5% COGS change = 5% profit change)
- Focus: Important to monitor as scale
- Implication: Design support model for scalability

Rank 4: S&M Efficiency
- Impact: High sensitivity if S&M very inefficient (>50%)
- Focus: Important but manageable
- Implication: Standard industry efficiency (40%) is achievable

CRITICAL INSIGHTS:
- Customer acquisition is THE driver (80% of variance)
- If we can acquire customers as planned, profitability path is clear
- Price is less sensitive (but still important; don't leave money on table)
- Cost efficiency matters but is secondary
- RECOMMENDATION: Focus relentlessly on customer acquisition; rest follows
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Exhaustive sensitivity analysis
- ❌ All possible combinations tested
- ❌ Mathematical precision
- ❌ Professional data visualization

# Hypothesis Testing Quality Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that hypotheses have been clearly articulated, test methods are rigorous and appropriate, and results are documented with sufficient clarity to inform strategic decisions and next actions.

## What Gets Validated

**Task Reference:** `tasks/hypothesis-testing.md`

**Used In:** SPLIT and ANALYSE phases for validation of beliefs and assumptions

**Audience:** Strategic analysts, decision-makers, those validating strategic assumptions

---

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Hypotheses Are Clearly Stated ✓

- [ ] **Each hypothesis is specific and testable**
  - Hypothesis is clear and unambiguous
  - Could be proven true or false (not vague)
  - Focused on one claim (not multiple claims)
  - Written in if-then or statement form

- [ ] **Hypotheses are grounded in context**
  - Why does this hypothesis matter?
  - How does it connect to strategic problem?
  - What decision depends on this hypothesis?
  - What's the business implication if wrong?

- [ ] **Hypotheses have stated assumptions**
  - What beliefs underlie this hypothesis?
  - What would need to be true for hypothesis to be valid?
  - What could make hypothesis false?
  - Are assumptions realistic?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT (Good):
"If we reduce SMB product price by 25%, customer acquisition in the
mid-market segment will increase by at least 40% within 6 months."

Why: Mid-market customers cite price as primary barrier (exit interviews)
Decision: Determines if price reduction is viable go-to-market strategy
Assumption 1: Demand exists at lower price (not just perception)
Assumption 2: Competitor response won't undermine price advantage
Assumption 3: Profitability remains acceptable at lower margin
Implication: If false, SMB market entry requires different approach

HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT (Bad - Too Vague):
"Customers like lower prices."
Why: Doesn't specify amount, customer segment, or timeframe
Decision: Unclear how this informs decision
Assumption: Unclear what we're testing
Implication: Could mean almost anything; hard to test

HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT (Bad - Too Broad):
"Our product positioning, pricing, and feature set are all wrong."
Why: Three different claims; can't test all at once
Better: Break into separate hypotheses:
  H1: Current positioning doesn't resonate with target segment
  H2: Current pricing exceeds willingness to pay
  H3: Current features don't match buyer needs
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Mathematical formulation
- ❌ Perfect precision
- ❌ Formal hypothesis notation
- ❌ Quantified success criteria (ranges acceptable)

---

### 2. Test Method Is Defined & Appropriate ✓

- [ ] **Test method matches hypothesis type**
  - Is method appropriate for this type of claim?
  - Could this method prove/disprove hypothesis?
  - Is method feasible within constraints?
  - Are there simpler alternative methods?

- [ ] **Test design is sound**
  - What specifically will be tested?
  - How will evidence be collected?
  - What sample size is adequate?
  - How will results be measured?

- [ ] **Test validity is considered**
  - Could test results be misinterpreted?
  - Are alternative explanations for results addressed?
  - Are biases or confounding factors managed?
  - Is test rigorous enough to trust?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
HYPOTHESIS: "Reducing price by 25% increases mid-market demand 40%+
within 6 months"

TEST METHOD 1: Pricing Experiment (Most Rigorous)
- Setup: Offer two cohorts with different pricing
  Cohort A: Current pricing ($10K/month)
  Cohort B: Reduced pricing ($7.5K/month)
- Sample: 50-100 new mid-market prospects
- Duration: 6 months of sales/trial tracking
- Measure: CAC, sales cycle, conversion rate comparison
- Analysis: Did Cohort B convert 40%+ faster than A?

Why This Works:
✓ Tests actual customer behavior (not stated preferences)
✓ Isolates price as variable (other factors held constant)
✓ Real market conditions
✓ Observable results

Limitation:
- Requires marketing discipline (can't change pitch between cohorts)
- May damage brand if pricing inconsistency discovered
- Results take 6 months; decision needed sooner?

TEST METHOD 2: Customer Interview (Faster, Less Rigorous)
- Setup: Show mid-market prospects two pricing options
  Option A: Current pricing ($10K/month)
  Option B: Reduced pricing ($7.5K/month)
- Sample: 20-30 in-depth interviews with target segment prospects
- Measure: At which price would you consider buying?
- Analysis: Do prospects move from no/maybe to yes at lower price?

Why This Works:
✓ Fast feedback (weeks, not months)
✓ Understand decision logic
✓ Explore willingness to pay

Limitation:
- Stated preference, not revealed preference (gap exists)
- Small sample; may not be representative
- Interview bias possible
- Doesn't measure 40% increase; just directional

TEST METHOD 3: Price Testing Page (Medium Rigor)
- Setup: Landing page with pricing option; A/B test
  Variant A: Current pricing message
  Variant B: "25% discount for early adopters" message
- Sample: 500+ prospects through marketing channels
- Measure: Click-through, sign-up, trial conversion
- Analysis: Does discount message increase conversion 40%?

Why This Works:
✓ Large sample; statistical power
✓ Real behavior (clicking/signing up)
✓ Relatively fast (weeks)

Limitation:
- Tests messaging, not actual pricing
- Discount perception may not translate to purchase
- Only measures short-term interest, not 6-month commitment

RECOMMENDED: METHOD 1 (Pricing Experiment)
This is the most rigorous test for this specific hypothesis. Trade-off
of cost and time is worth it for a go/no-go decision of this magnitude.
METHOD 2 and 3 as supporting evidence to build confidence.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect experimental design
- ❌ Statistically significant sample sizes
- ❌ Rigorous research methodology
- ❌ Control of all variables

---

### 3. Test Parameters Are Clear ✓

- [ ] **Success criteria are defined**
  - What result would prove hypothesis true?
  - What result would disprove it?
  - What's the threshold for success?
  - Is threshold realistic and defensible?

- [ ] **Test constraints are stated**
  - What's the timeline for testing?
  - What's the budget/resource limit?
  - What's the risk if wrong?
  - What's the cost of not testing?

- [ ] **Decision rule is established**
  - If test supports hypothesis → What's next?
  - If test doesn't support hypothesis → What's next?
  - What's the threshold for "good enough"?
  - Who decides interpretation?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
HYPOTHESIS: "Reducing price 25% increases mid-market demand 40%+"

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✓ Hypothesis TRUE if: Cohort B (reduced price) achieves 40%+ higher
  conversion rate than Cohort A (current price)
  Example: If A converts at 10%, then B must convert at 14%+
  Example: If A closes 5 deals, then B must close 7+

✓ Hypothesis FALSE if: Conversion rate difference <20%
  (Could still help, but not 40% impact expected)

? INCONCLUSIVE if: 20-40% difference
  (Results suggest hypothesis partially true; not clear)

TEST CONSTRAINTS:
- Timeline: 6 months (need decision sooner?)
- Budget: Can absorb lost margin from 50-100 discounted customers
- Risk if wrong: Bad precedent if customers later refuse to pay full price
- Cost of not testing: Making $1M+ pricing decision without data

DECISION RULE:
If Hypothesis TRUE (40%+ increase):
  → Approve SMB pricing strategy
  → Plan broader market launch
  → Implement pricing change company-wide

If Hypothesis FALSE (<20% increase):
  → Price isn't the problem
  → Revisit root cause analysis
  → Test other hypotheses (features, positioning)

If INCONCLUSIVE (20-40%):
  → Consider price as helpful but not sufficient
  → Combine with other improvements
  → Test longer (full 6 months vs. early stop)

DECISION MAKER: VP Product + Chief Commercial Officer
DECISION TIMING: After 6-month test window (or interim decision if clear trend)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect thresholds
- ❌ Mathematical rigor
- ❌ Stakeholder agreement
- ❌ Certainty about decision

```
TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY:

PLAN vs. REALITY:

Planned: 6-month pricing experiment with 50-100 mid-market prospects
Actually: 5.5 months; 78 prospects; one deviation

Planned: 50 prospects in each cohort (A and B)
Actually: Cohort A: 39 prospects; Cohort B: 39 prospects
Why: Sales team naturally split pipeline 50-50

Planned: Sales team consistent in pitch between cohorts
Actually: Sales team knew different prices offered
  Issue: Possible unconscious bias (e.g., selling harder on discount)
  Mitigation: Reviewed calls for consistency; no major differences found
  Impact: MEDIUM (Could inflate B's success slightly)

Planned: 6-month tracking period
Actually: 5.5 months (customer urgency; needed decision sooner)
  Issue: Less time for full sales cycle to complete
  Impact: MEDIUM (Some prospects still in consideration)
  Mitigation: Tracked status; extrapolated to full 6 months

DATA COLLECTION:

Cohort A (Current Pricing - $10K/month):
- Prospects contacted: 39
- Trials started: 26 (67%)
- Customers converted: 4 (10% of prospects; 15% of trials)
- Average sales cycle: 8.2 weeks
- Feedback: Price seen as justified; concerned about commitment

Cohort B (Discounted Pricing - $7.5K/month):
- Prospects contacted: 39
- Trials started: 32 (82%)
- Customers converted: 7 (18% of prospects; 22% of trials)
- Average sales cycle: 6.1 weeks
- Feedback: Price attractive; faster buying decision

DATA QUALITY:
- CRM data: HIGH confidence (automated tracking)
- Trial data: HIGH confidence (product logs)
- Conversion data: MEDIUM confidence (some manual entry)
- Feedback: MEDIUM confidence (subjective interpretation)

CONFOUNDING FACTORS MANAGED:
1. Sales team composition: Same rep balance across cohorts ✓
2. Prospect quality: Random assignment (not cherry-picked) ✓
3. Marketing message: Same message except pricing ✓
4. Product experience: Same product offered ✓
5. Timeline: Slight difference (5.5 vs. 6 months) - Minor impact
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect execution
- ❌ Zero deviations from plan
- ❌ Perfect data quality
- ❌ Rigorous statistical controls

**What This Looks Like:**

```
TEST RESULTS ANALYSIS:

HEADLINE RESULT:
Hypothesis: "25% price reduction increases demand 40%+"
Test Result: 80% increase in conversion rate (10% → 18%)
Verdict: HYPOTHESIS TRUE (exceeds 40% target)

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

Metric Comparison:

                    Cohort A      Cohort B      Difference
                    (Current)     (Discount)
Prospects           39            39            —
Trial conversion    67%           82%           +15pp
Customer conversion 10%           18%           +8pp
Sales cycle         8.2 weeks     6.1 weeks     -2.1 weeks
NPS (new customers) 62            68            +6 pts

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Conversion significantly higher at discounted price (+80%)
2. Trial-to-customer higher at discounted price (+47%)
3. Sales cycle faster at discounted price (-25%)
4. Customer satisfaction similar (NPS both strong)
5. Retention rates equal at 6-month mark (no early churn)

CAUSATION ANALYSIS:
Does discount pricing CAUSE higher conversion?

Evidence FOR causation:
✓ Price was the only variable changed
✓ Difference is directionally expected (lower price → more buyers)
✓ Effect size is substantial (not marginal)
✓ Multiple metrics show same direction (conversion, cycle, trials)

Evidence suggesting other factors:
? Sales team bias: May have sold harder on discount option
? Prospect perception: Discount signaled "limited time" (urgency bias)
? Selection effect: Different type of prospect got discount message

Confidence in causation: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Directional evidence is strong
- Alternative factors possible but unlikely to explain full difference
- Test design isolated price reasonably well
- Recommend follow-up test to validate

GENERALIZABILITY:
Will results hold for:
✓ Similar mid-market prospects? YES (high confidence)
✓ Different industries? MAYBE (test was B2B SaaS; may vary by vertical)
✓ Longer-term (1+ years)? UNKNOWN (only tested 6 months)
✓ Full-scale rollout? MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (small sample; growth may change)

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW:
- Would discount harm premium positioning/brand?
- What's the price elasticity? (40% discount → 80% conversion increase;
  what about 10% or 50% discount?)
- How would competitors respond? (Would they match discount?)
- Would existing customers demand same discount retroactively?
- Would discount customers be as loyal long-term?

RECOMMENDATION:
Results strongly support hypothesis. Recommend moving forward with
25% discount pricing for SMB segment launch. Recommend monitoring
for brand impact and competitor response.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Statistical significance testing
- ❌ Perfect causal proof
- ❌ Answers to all questions
- ❌ Risk-free conclusion

  - Is action plan clear?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
TEST CONCLUSION:

HYPOTHESIS VERDICT: TRUE ✓
Hypothesis: "Reducing price 25% increases mid-market demand 40%+"
Result: 80% increase in conversion (10% → 18%)
Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (strong evidence; some alternative factors possible)
Caveats: Results from 78 prospects over 5.5 months; may not generalize
         to different market conditions or competitor responses

WHAT THIS MEANS STRATEGICALLY:
Price IS a material barrier to mid-market adoption. Removing barrier
via 25% discount significantly improves conversion. This validates
strategy of entering SMB market with differentiated (lower) pricing.

NEXT ACTIONS:

If Approved (Recommended):
1. IMMEDIATE (This week):
   - Approve SMB pricing strategy
   - Notify executive team of results
   - Update financial model with new conversion assumptions

2. PHASE 1 (Next 2-4 weeks):
   - Develop full SMB product and go-to-market plan
   - Design brand/positioning for SMB segment
   - Build sales process for SMB channel
   - Create implementation timeline

3. PHASE 2 (Month 2-3):
   - Launch beta with willing customers from test
   - Refine product based on early feedback
   - Build sales team/process
   - Prepare full market launch

4. PHASE 3 (Month 4-6):
   - Full market launch
   - Monitor competitor response
   - Track actual conversion rates vs. test results
   - Adjust if needed

DECISION REQUIRED: CEO approval to proceed with SMB segment launch
TIMELINE: Decision needed by [DATE]; launch in Month 4
OWNER: Chief Product Officer

If Results Questioned:
→ Conduct follow-up test on broader sample
→ Test different price points ($7K, $8K, $9K)
→ Run A/B test on brand impact
→ Gather competitive intelligence on response

RISK MITIGATION:
- Monitor: Brand impact (premium perception)
- Monitor: Competitor response (do they match discount?)
- Monitor: Customer sentiment (will they demand discount retroactively?)
- Contingency: If brand harm detected, qualify discount to new customers only
- Contingency: If competitors match aggressively, prepare for lower margins
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Exhaustive action plans
- ❌ Timeline to the day
- ❌ Risk-elimination
- ❌ Unanimous stakeholder agreement

- Revenue share from marketplace (transparent model)
- Lower barrier to entry (use our platform vs. build alone)

For platform customers:
- Access to more integrations (without wait for us)
- Faster time-to-value (partners can build critical gaps)
- More choice of solutions (pick best solution, not just ours)
- Community-driven roadmap (partners respond to customer needs)

BUSINESS VALUE:

Revenue:
- Take 25% revenue share on partner integrations
- Estimate 30 partners, 10 integrations each = 300 integrations
- Average $500/month per integration = $150K revenue from marketplace
- Year 1: Modest; Year 3: Could be significant revenue stream

Cost savings:
- Instead of engineering team building integrations (30% of R&D)
- Partners build them, we take revenue share
- Frees 10 engineers for core product (estimated $1.5M value)

Competitive advantage:
- Ecosystem that competitors can't easily replicate
- Network effect: More integrations = more value = stickier
- Market differentiation: "Most extensible platform"
- Switching costs increase for customers

CAUSE & EFFECT:
More integrations → Customer value increases → Customer stickiness increases
→ Churn decreases & expansion increases → LTV increases → Business value

- Establish partner onboarding process
- Create revenue share model and terms
- Document partner API and tooling

Resources:
- 2 engineers (marketplace infrastructure)
- 1 product manager
- 1 ops person (partner management)
- Total: 4 FTE + $1M spend

Phase 2: Partner Recruitment (Months 3-12)
Activities:
- Identify partner targets (integration developers, agencies)
- Develop partner program
- Recruit initial partners (10-15)
- Support initial integrations
- Iterate based on feedback

Resources:
- 1 partnerships manager
- 1 technical relationship manager
- 1 ops person
- Total: 3 FTE + $500K spend

Phase 3: Launch & Scale (Months 13-18)
Activities:
- Public marketplace launch
- Marketing to partners and customers
- Scale from 10 to 30+ partners
- Marketplace optimization (search, rating, recommendation)
- Iterate based on usage

Resources:
- 1 marketplace manager
- 2 engineers (optimization)
- 1 marketing person
- Total: 4 FTE + $500K spend

TIMELINE: 18 months, $2M investment

KEY SUCCESS FACTORS:

Must succeed:
1. Partners find marketplace valuable (need 10+ committed partners)
2. Customers discover and use partner integrations (adoption critical)
3. Revenue model is attractive for partners (not too high cut)
4. Quality standards are maintained (bad integrations harm brand)

Would validate:
1. Partner interest (survey/call 20 potential partners)
2. Customer demand (survey customers on integration wishes)
3. Revenue model (10 partners, see if model works)
4. Quality standards (can we enforce through code review?)

RISKS:

Risk 1: Partners not interested in program
Probability: MEDIUM (some programs struggle to get partners)
Impact: HIGH (kills whole initiative)
Mitigation: Survey partners early; validate interest before investing

Risk 2: Customers don't discover integrations
Probability: MEDIUM (discoverability is challenging)
Impact: HIGH (integrations don't get used)
Mitigation: Strong partnerships; customer education; marketing

Risk 3: Quality issues with third-party integrations
Probability: MEDIUM (harder to enforce than internal)
Impact: MEDIUM (harms brand if bad integrations available)
Mitigation: Code review process; standards; ability to remove bad ones
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Detailed project plans
- ❌ Complete resource specifications
- ❌ Perfect timeline
- ❌ Risk-free approach

WHAT MAKES THIS INNOVATION:

New capability we're adding:
- Currently: We're closed platform (our engineers build integrations)
- New: Open platform (partners build integrations)
- Benefit: 10x faster integration development

Unique approach:
- Others have marketplaces (app stores)
- Ours would be different: Partner-built integrations our focus
- Model: Revenue sharing vs. appstore commission model
- Differentiation: True partner ecosystem vs. consumer app store

Hard to replicate:
- Takes years to build partner ecosystem (network effect)
- Our install base of customers = valuable for partners
- Once built, others can't easily compete (switching costs)
- Defensible competitive moat

BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL:

If execution works:
- Transforms us from product company to platform company
- Ecosystem competitive advantage
- Expansion of TAM through partner innovation
- New revenue stream (marketplace take rate)

Upside scenario:
- 500+ integrations by Year 5 (vs. 90 we could build)
- Become "most integrated platform"
- Customer stickiness increases 30%
- New revenue stream: $10M+ annually

Moonshot:
- Become "integration platform of choice"
- Ecosystem becomes moat
- Platform enables partners to build businesses on our platform
- We become infrastructure play (like AWS for integrations)

LONG-TERM VISION:

Year 1: Validate marketplace viability with 20-30 partners
Year 2: Scale to 100+ partners; marketplace becomes self-sustaining
Year 3: Platform becomes primary source of integrations
Year 5: Partner ecosystem is competitive differentiator
Year 10: Become industry standard for integration partnerships

The dream: "The Salesforce AppExchange for data integration"
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Guaranteed breakthrough
- ❌ Perfect articulation
- ❌ Certainty about long-term vision
- ❌ 10x outcomes (would be nice, not required)

# INSIGHT Phase Completion Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that the INSIGHT phase (Strategic Communicator) has completed all essential work before transitioning to the STORY phase. This checklist ensures analysis findings have been synthesized into strategic insights with clear implications and opportunities identified.

## What This Phase Accomplishes

The INSIGHT phase takes rigorous analysis and transforms it into strategic meaning. The Strategic Communicator ensures:
- Key findings are synthesized into insights
- "So what?" implications are clear
- Strategic opportunities are identified
- Innovation possibilities are surfaced
- Foundation for narrative is established

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Findings Synthesis ✓

- [ ] **Analysis findings reviewed and organized**
  - All key findings from ANALYSE phase reviewed
  - Findings organized by theme/component
  - Supporting evidence identified for each finding
  - Relative importance/impact of findings ranked

- [ ] **Key insights extracted from findings**
  - For each major finding: "So what?" articulated
  - Business implications of findings stated
  - Strategic implications identified
  - Assumptions underlying insights documented

- [ ] **Competing or conflicting findings reconciled**
  - Any contradictory findings addressed
  - Different interpretations explored
  - Most likely interpretation selected (with rationale)
  - Remaining uncertainties noted

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Finding:** SMB customers churn because our pricing is 25% above competitors
- **Insight:** We've positioned ourselves as premium player but SMB segment values cost; strategic choice needed between (a) defending premium positioning in enterprise, or (b) creating value-tier for SMB
- **Implication:** Pricing strategy is not a tactic; it's a strategic positioning choice that will determine market position

- **Finding:** Enterprise customers very stable (95% retention) and growing
- **Insight:** We're winning the right market segment for profitability; growth opportunity is deepening enterprise relationships, not expanding to SMB
- **Implication:** Product roadmap should focus on enterprise-tier features and integrations, not broad consumer-style features

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ New analysis
- ❌ Perfect reconciliation of all findings
- ❌ Final strategic recommendations
- ❌ Complete certainty

---

### 2. Opportunity Identification ✓

- [ ] **Strategic opportunities identified**
  - Beyond fixing problems, where is growth opportunity?
  - Where can we create competitive advantage?
  - What market dynamics can we leverage?
  - Emerging needs or trends visible?

- [ ] **Opportunities grounded in analysis**
  - Each opportunity connected to findings
  - Customer demand/market potential evident
  - Competitive landscape enables opportunity
  - Feasibility assessed (at least directionally)

- [ ] **Opportunities prioritized**
  - High-impact opportunities identified
  - Medium-impact opportunities noted
  - Long-shot opportunities listed (with caveats)
  - Top 3-5 focused opportunities selected

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Opportunity 1 (High Impact):** Create SMB-friendly pricing tier with simplified feature set; market research shows 500 similar-stage companies at risk of churning; TAM ~$50M
- **Opportunity 2 (High Impact):** Build API-first integration marketplace for enterprise segment; currently #1 customer request; competitive advantage opportunity; requires 6-month build
- **Opportunity 3 (Medium Impact):** Expand to international markets; customer demand emerging in UK/EU; competitive positioning opportunity in less mature markets
- **Opportunity 4 (Long-shot):** Acquire smaller competitor with complementary features; would address feature gaps, but high risk/cost

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Fully developed business cases
- ❌ Exact opportunity sizing
- ❌ Feasibility studies
- ❌ Complete competitive analysis of opportunities

---

### 3. Strategic Positioning Clarity ✓

  - Does positioning match market reality?
  - Are we positioned for profitable growth?

- [ ] **Positioning implications identified**
  - If we continue current positioning, what happens?
  - What does current positioning require (product, pricing, marketing)?
  - What segment are we best positioned for?
  - What are we leaving on the table with this positioning?

- [ ] **Positioning alternatives considered**
  - What if we repositioned differently?
  - What would each alternative require?
  - What would we gain/lose with each?
  - Which positioning best leverages our advantages?

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Current Position:** Premium, enterprise-focused, high-touch support
- **Assessment:** Position is sound for enterprise; highly profitable; but limits total market opportunity
- **Implication:** Can grow with enterprise market (healthy 25%+ annually) or pursue SMB via different brand/product

- **Conclusion:** Positioning is strategic choice; implications clear; execution different for each segment

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Marketing positioning statements
- ❌ Brand strategy
- ❌ Detailed go-to-market implications
- ❌ Final decision on positioning

---

### 4. Insight Communication Clarity ✓

- [ ] **Key insights can be articulated simply**

  - Business significance is clear
  - Language is accessible (not overly technical)
  - Each insight answers a "so what?" question

- [ ] **Insight hierarchy is clear**
  - What are the 1-2 most critical insights?
  - What supporting insights matter?
  - What are "nice to know" insights?
  - What is the through-line connecting them?

- [ ] **Implications are action-oriented**
  - Each insight points toward possible actions
  - Decisions are suggested (not made)
  - Trade-offs are visible
  - Path forward is clearer

- **Core Insight:** "We've optimized for enterprise profitability but left significant market opportunity on the table in SMB segment"
  - **Supporting Insight 1:** "Churn is concentrated in SMB; enterprise is highly stable"
  - **Supporting Insight 2:** "Competitors are winning SMB through aggressive pricing; we're losing on price but winning on features"
  - **Supporting Insight 3:** "Market opportunity is substantial; creating SMB tier would address 60% of churn and open new revenue stream"
  - **Implication:** Strategic choice needed: defend premium positioning or expand downmarket with separate offering

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect articulation
- ❌ Unanimous agreement
- ❌ Final narrative (that's STORY phase)
- ❌ Recommendation (that's DECIDE phase)

---

  - What if we changed delivery model? (On-premise → SaaS?)
  - What if we changed customer? (Enterprise → SMB?) (Already covered above)
  - What's possible with different economics?

- [ ] **Competitive disruption possibilities explored**
  - How could we disrupt our own market?
  - What would force incumbents to respond?
  - Where is market vulnerable to disruption?
  - What's our advantage in disrupting (or defending)?

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Breakthrough Idea:** "What if we moved from perpetual-license model to outcome-based pricing where customer pays based on business results?"
  - This would align our incentives with customer success
  - Would require different sales approach, support model, implementation
  - Could be major competitive differentiator; hard to copy

- **Business Model Idea:** "What if we created a platform ecosystem where 3rd-party developers build on our APIs?"
  - Would accelerate feature development
  - Would create switching costs (built-in ecosystem)
  - Could address feature-gap challenge through partner innovations

- **Disruption Idea:** "What if we started with SMB segment (underserved) and moved upmarket to enterprise later?"
  - Different from current enterprise-down strategy
  - Would require different product/GTM/support
  - Could establish strong SMB moat before competitors move downmarket

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Business plans for innovations
- ❌ Feasibility studies
- ❌ Product specifications
- ❌ Decision on which to pursue

---

  - If downmarket, what's the go-to-market (new brand? separate org? existing channel?)
  - What do we do about current SMB customers (price changes? feature tiers? migration path?)
  - How fast must we move (market window; competitive threat)?

- **Narrative Foundation:**
  - Story: "From premium single-segment focus to double-sided growth strategy"
  - Journey: Current state (enterprise success, missed market) → Realization (SMB opportunity) → Strategic choice → Execution
  - Emotional core: "We can have it both ways - enterprise excellence AND market leadership"
  - Call-to-action: Let's strategically choose our market approach and go all-in on winning

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Final narrative

# Market Sizing Quality Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that market sizing has used appropriate methodologies, documented assumptions transparently, and sized TAM/SAM/SOM with sufficient rigor to support investment and go-to-market decisions.

## What Gets Validated

**Task Reference:** `tasks/market-sizing-analysis.md`

**Used In:** ANALYSE phase for market opportunity assessment and validation

**Audience:** Strategic analysts, investment decision-makers, business planners

---

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. TAM (Total Addressable Market) Is Sized ✓

- [ ] **TAM definition is clear**
  - What products/services included?
  - What geographies included?
  - What customer segments included?
  - Why these boundaries?

- [ ] **TAM is sized using appropriate method**
  - Top-down approach used (start from total market; drill down)
  - Bottom-up approach used (sum customer segments)
  - Or combination of methods
  - Method choice is justified

- [ ] **TAM sizing is supported by data**
  - What data sources used?
  - How recent is data?
  - How relevant to market?
  - Are sources credible?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
TAM DEFINITION:

Market: Enterprise software for supply chain optimization
Geography: North America (US + Canada)
Customers: Manufacturing companies with >$50M annual revenue
Time Period: 2025

Why These Boundaries:
- Supply chain optimization (not adjacent areas like logistics)
- North America first (geography of focus; represents 40% global TAM)
- Mid-to-large manufacturers (have budget; face pain point)
- 2025 (current year; base for projections)

TAM SIZING - TOP-DOWN METHOD:

Total Enterprise Software Market (North America): $140B
Supply Chain Software Subset: 8% of enterprise software = $11.2B
Optimization-specific portion: 35% of supply chain = $3.9B

TAM: $3.9B

TAM SIZING - BOTTOM-UP METHOD:

Target Companies: Manufacturing with >$50M revenue (North America)
Total companies in this category: 4,200
Average spend on supply chain optimization: $925K/year
(Based on analysis of 50+ company spends)

TAM: 4,200 × $925K = $3.9B

CONVERGENCE: Both methods = $3.9B ✓

DATA SOURCES:
- IDC market research (report from 2024): $11.2B supply chain software
- LinkedIn data: 4,200 qualifying manufacturers
- Customer interviews (30): Average spend $925K
- Gartner report: 35% of supply chain is optimization-focused

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Methods converge (strong signal)
- Data is recent (within 1-2 years)
- Multiple sources provide validation
- Some estimate work required
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect methodology
- ❌ Multiple independent methods
- ❌ Academic precision
- ❌ Real-time market data

---

### 2. SAM (Serviceable Available Market) Is Sized ✓

- [ ] **SAM definition is realistic**
  - What portion of TAM is realistic to target?
  - What's our geographic focus?
  - What's our customer segment focus?
  - What's driving the boundary?

- [ ] **SAM sizing is justified**
  - Why this percentage of TAM?
  - Is this realistic for our capabilities?
  - Have we considered competitive landscape?
  - Have we considered market dynamics?

- [ ] **SAM is bounded by constraints**
  - Geographic constraints stated
  - Segment constraints stated
  - Product constraints stated
  - Capability/resource constraints stated

**What This Looks Like:**

```
SAM DEFINITION:

TAM: $3.9B (North America supply chain optimization)

Geographic SAM: North America; focusing on US only
Why: US represents 85% of North America opportunity; simpler to
execute than US + Canada split

Segment SAM: Manufacturing with >$50M revenue in automotive,
food processing, and pharmaceuticals (3 verticals)
Why: These 3 verticals have highest supply chain optimization needs
(regulatory, complexity, cost sensitivity). Together represent 60%
of mid-to-large manufacturers. Starting with sweet-spot segments
before expanding to other manufacturing verticals.

Product SAM: Demand planning and inventory optimization
Why: This is where our product strength is. Full supply chain
optimization includes procurement, logistics, warehouse management
(too broad for focused entry).

SAM CALCULATION:

Total TAM: $3.9B

Geographic adjustment: 85% for US only = $3.3B
Segment adjustment: 60% for 3 verticals = $1.98B
Product adjustment: 35% for demand + inventory = $693M

SAM: $693M

CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:

Geographic Feasibility:
- US market is large enough for meaningful business
- Language/regulatory single country simplifies launch
- Can expand to Canada later once US established
- 85% focus makes sense

Segment Feasibility:
- 3 verticals chosen because:
  * Automotive: High complexity, mature, sophisticated buyers
  * Food Processing: Regulatory pressure, perishable goods urgency
  * Pharma: Regulatory + cold chain complexity
- Together ~1,250 qualifying companies
- Achievable target for sales team

Product Feasibility:
- Demand planning: Core competency (proven in customers)
- Inventory optimization: Extension (related capability)
- Rest of supply chain: Future expansion (not core now)
- 35% of market is realistic for focused product

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM
- Geographic focus is conservative and realistic
- Segment focus makes strategic sense
- Product scope is defensible
- But these are partially discretionary choices
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect segment definition
- ❌ Conservative or aggressive positioning
- ❌ Proven market access
- ❌ Competitor agreement

---

### 3. SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) Is Sized ✓

- [ ] **SOM definition reflects realistic expectations**
  - What's achievable in 3-5 years?
  - What market share is realistic?
  - What's the basis for share assumption?
  - Have you considered competition?

- [ ] **SOM assumptions are grounded**
  - Market share assumption: What % of SAM?
  - Is this based on data or comparable companies?
  - Have competitive dynamics been considered?
  - Is growth rate realistic?

- [ ] **SOM takes market conditions into account**
  - Market growth rate included?
  - Competitive saturation considered?
  - Customer adoption curves modeled?
  - Distribution/channel constraints noted?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
SOM DEFINITION & SIZING:

SAM (Total opportunity): $693M

Market Share Assumptions:
1. Market growth: 15% annually (supply chain optimization growing
   faster than overall enterprise software)
2. Competitive share: Dominated by 3-4 players (relatively
   concentrated; some room for new entrant)
3. Our realistic share by Year 5: 8-12% of SAM
   (Based on comparable SaaS companies in adjacent markets)
4. Expected customers by Year 5: 120-150 companies

SOM CALCULATION:

Year 1: $693M SAM × 1% market penetration = $6.9M opportunity
Year 2: $800M SAM × 2% market penetration = $16M opportunity
Year 3: $920M SAM × 4% market penetration = $36.8M opportunity
Year 4: $1.06B SAM × 7% market penetration = $74.2M opportunity
Year 5: $1.22B SAM × 10% market penetration = $122M opportunity

SOM (5-year achievable): $122M in serviceable obtainable market

MARKET SHARE RATIONALE:

Why 10% by Year 5?
- Comparable companies (3 peers): Average 8-15% share of addressable market
- Our advantages: Superior product-market fit in chosen segments
- Our disadvantages: Late entrant; incumbents entrenched
- Realistic: 10% is achievable but requires strong execution
- Aggressive but not unrealistic

Why gradual ramp (1% → 2% → 4% → 7% → 10%)?
- Year 1: Establish product-market fit; build reference customers
- Year 2-3: Build sales team; establish market presence
- Year 4-5: Scale with brand and network effects
- Follows typical SaaS adoption curve for enterprise software

COMPETITION CONSIDERED:
- 2 major incumbents (each with 25-30% share)
- 3-4 specialized competitors (each with 5-10% share)
- Together control ~80% of market
- Remaining 20% available for new entrants + others
- Our 10% target represents ~50% of available share (aggressive but possible)

MARKET CONSTRAINTS:
- Adoption cycle: 6-9 months for typical customer
- Sales cycle: 3-4 months (enterprise software)
- Implementation: 3-6 months post-sale
- This limits Year 1 customer additions; affects ramp
- But by Year 3 we hit inflection with reference customers

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM
- Market growth assumption reasonable (industry growth 12-18%)
- Market share assumption realistic (comparable to similar companies)
- Gradual ramp makes sense (matches sales build and adoption)
- Competition recognized but market large enough for us
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect share predictions
- ❌ Aggressive or conservative positioning
- ❌ Proven market access
- ❌ Detailed customer acquisition cost analysis

- [ ] **Assumptions are justified**
  - Why this growth rate?
  - Why this market share?
  - What data supports assumption?
  - What would change assumption?

- [ ] **Sensitivity to assumptions is analyzed**
  - What if growth is half expected?
  - What if market share is 5% not 10%?
  - What if customer acquisition slower?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
KEY ASSUMPTIONS & SENSITIVITY:

Assumption 1: Market grows 15% annually
Base case: 15%
Optimistic: 20% (adoption accelerates)
Pessimistic: 10% (market slower than expected)
Impact on SOM:
  If 20% growth: Year 5 SAM = $1.46B; 10% share = $146M
  If 10% growth: Year 5 SAM = $1.10B; 10% share = $110M
Sensitivity: MEDIUM (could swing SOM ±20%)

Assumption 2: We achieve 10% market share by Year 5
Base case: 10%
Optimistic: 15% (we gain share faster than expected)
Pessimistic: 5% (competitive pressure limits us)
Impact on SOM:
  If 15% share: $1.22B × 15% = $183M
  If 5% share: $1.22B × 5% = $61M
Sensitivity: HIGH (could swing SOM ±50%)

Assumption 3: Customer acquisition ramps gradually
Base case: 1% → 2% → 4% → 7% → 10% per year
Optimistic: 2% → 4% → 8% → 12% → 15% (faster adoption)
Pessimistic: 0.5% → 1% → 2% → 4% → 6% (slower adoption)
Impact on SOM:
  If faster: Year 5 share reaches 15%; = $183M
  If slower: Year 5 share reaches 6%; = $73M
Sensitivity: HIGH (depends on sales execution)

Assumption 4: Average customer value stable at $925K/year
Base case: $925K
Optimistic: $1.2M (land and expand; higher ACV)
Pessimistic: $750K (price pressure; lower ACV)
Impact on SOM:
  If $1.2M: $1.22B ÷ $1.2M = 1,017 customers
  If $750K: $1.22B ÷ $750K = 1,627 customers
Sensitivity: MEDIUM (could shift customer count 40%)

SENSITIVITY SUMMARY:

Most sensitive to: Market share assumption (±50% swing)
Moderately sensitive to: Growth rate (±20% swing)
Least sensitive to: Customer value (±40% customer count)

Recommendation: Market share is biggest driver of value. Focus on
validating ability to compete and gain share.

### 6. Market Sizing Is Internally Consistent ✓

- [ ] **TAM, SAM, SOM hierarchy makes sense**
  - Does SOM < SAM < TAM?
  - Are percentages realistic?
  - Do definitions align across levels?
  - Is progression logical?

- [ ] **Sizing aligns with business plan**
  - Do revenue projections match SOM?
  - Do customer acquisition plans match SOM?
  - Do go-to-market plans reflect SAM?
  - Is everything coherent?

- [ ] **Sizing is documented clearly**
  - Could someone understand methodology?
  - Are sources cited?
  - Are assumptions stated?
  - Are calculations shown?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
INTERNAL CONSISTENCY CHECK:

TAM > SAM > SOM? ✓
$3.9B > $693M > $122M

Percentage Breakdowns:
- SAM = 18% of TAM (17.8% exactly) ✓
- SOM = 8% of SAM (17.6% of SAM) ✓
- SOM = 3% of TAM (3.1% exactly) ✓

Consistency with Business Plan:

Revenue Projection:
Year 5 projection: $40M ARR (assume $925K customer ACV)
= 43 customers by Year 5

SOM calculation suggests:
$122M ÷ $925K ACV = 132 customers by Year 5

Our plan: 43 customers = 3.5% of available SOM
Assessment: CONSERVATIVE (only capturing 3.5% of available opportunity)
Why conservative? Early years are about establishing product-market fit,
not maximizing market capture. Makes sense.

Sales Plan:
Year 1: 3-5 customers
Year 2: 12-15 customers
Year 3: 25-30 customers
Year 4: 35-40 customers
Year 5: 43-45 customers (goal)

Growth rate: 80%+ annually for first 3 years; slowing to 20% by Year 4-5
Assessment: MATCHES typical SaaS growth curve
Implied market share: Reaches 3.5% of SOM by Year 5
Assessment: REASONABLE given market concentration and competition

Go-to-Market Plan:
- Focus on 3 verticals (automotive, food, pharma)
- Direct sales team
- Start with 1 sales rep; grow to 3-4 by Year 3; 5-6 by Year 5

Assessment:
- 40-50 customers with 5-6 sales reps = 7-10 customers/rep/year
- Industry standard: 4-8 customers/rep/year for enterprise software
- Our plan: REASONABLE (slight upside to industry average, but achievable)

DOCUMENTATION QUALITY:

Methodology section: Clear, shows both top-down and bottom-up
Sources documented: ✓ (IDC, LinkedIn, customer interviews, Gartner)
Assumptions listed: ✓ (Growth rate, market share, ACV, adoption curve)
Sensitivity analysis: ✓ (Shows impact if assumptions wrong)
Competitive context: ✓ (Identifies major players and dynamics)
Clarity: ✓ (Someone could understand and replicate)

Overall Assessment: Sizing is coherent, well-documented, internally consistent.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect alignment
- ❌ Conservative or aggressive positioning
- ❌ Audit-ready documentation
- ❌ Zero gaps between plan and market

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Market Sizing is Ready When

All blocking criteria are met:
- TAM is sized with appropriate method
- SAM is sized realistically
- SOM is sized with justified assumptions
- Assumptions are transparent and sensitive
- Competitive landscape is understood
- Sizing is internally consistent

**Market sizing can support go/no-go decisions.**

---

### 🔄 Market Sizing Needs More Work When

- **TAM unclear?** → Clarify definition and methodology
- **SAM unrealistic?** → Justify boundaries or adjust
- **SOM not grounded?** → Base on comparable companies or data
- **Assumptions hidden?** → Document and justify
- **Competition ignored?** → Research and include
- **Internally inconsistent?** → Reconcile differences

---

## Common Issues & Resolution

| Issue | Signal | Resolution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **TAM too large** | "$100B opportunity" | Drill down to realistic SAM; reduce scope |
| **TAM not defensible** | "How did you get that number?" | Show methodology; cite sources; explain calculation |
| **No SAM definition** | "What's realistic for us?" | Define segment focus; customer constraints; geography |
| **SOM too aggressive** | "We'll own 30% of market" | Compare to competitors; use comparable companies; be conservative |
| **Hidden assumptions** | "Where did this come from?" | List assumptions; justify; show sources |
| **No competition** | "We're uncontested" | Research competitors; understand market dynamics |
| **Numbers don't align** | "Your revenue plan doesn't match SOM" | Reconcile; adjust either sizing or plan |

**What This Looks Like:**

```
CROSS-PHASE PATTERN ANALYSIS:

Pattern 1: Market Gap Is Real and Durable
Evidence:
- DEFINE: Customers cite positioning mismatch (SMB wants enterprise features at SMB pricing)
- SPLIT: Root cause analysis identified strategic gap
- ANALYSE: Competitive entry confirmed gap exists; competitors filling space
Strength: STRONG (validated across all phases)
Confidence: HIGH (multiple data sources converge)

Pattern 2: Vertical Expertise Is Defensible Advantage
Evidence:
- DEFINE: Discovery indicated vertical expertise would be valued
- SPLIT: Hypothesis testing showed willingness to pay premium for vertical
- ANALYSE: Competitive benchmarking showed no other player owns vertical positioning
Strength: STRONG (validated across phases)
Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (competitive advantage less certain; could be copied)

Pattern 3: Timeline Is Tight; Window Narrow
Evidence:
- DEFINE: Stakeholder feedback indicated urgency
- SPLIT: Root cause analysis showed competitive threat is accelerating
- ANALYSE: Competitive landscape shows consolidation happening now
Strength: STRONG (validated across phases)
Confidence: HIGH (market dynamics are observable)

Potential Concern: Financial Model Assumes Faster Ramp Than Industry Average
Evidence:
- DEFINE: No discussion of customer adoption curves
- SPLIT: Hypothesis testing showed market interest but no real data
- ANALYSE: Financial model assumes aggressive customer acquisition (6/year ramping to 40/year)
Risk: Model could be overly optimistic
Action needed: Validate customer adoption curves with real data

Core Strategic Insight:
Market gap is real, defensible via vertical expertise, and has narrow window.
Successful entry requires: (1) Fast product development, (2) Vertical differentiation,
(3) Quick customer acquisition, (4) Strong execution. Feasible but risky.

**What This Looks Like:**

```
STRATEGIC DIRECTION VALIDATION:

Original Question: Should we enter the SMB market?

Evidence-Based Answer: YES, we should enter SMB market via vertical-focused strategy.

Rationale:
1. Market gap is real and durable (multiple validation sources)
2. Gap is addressable via vertical expertise (defensible differentiation)
3. Window for entry is 12-18 months (competitive urgency is real)
4. Financial model shows viable path to profitability (Year 4)
5. Unit economics are strong (LTV:CAC 13:1; payback 7.5 months)
6. Risks are manageable (identified and mitigated)

Recommended Path:
1. Build separate SMB product (not embedded in enterprise)
2. Focus on 3 verticals (automotive, pharma, food processing)
3. Differentiate via vertical expertise (not horizontal breadth)
4. Target premium pricing ($60-80K ACV)
5. Launch MVP Month 6; market launch Month 12
6. Reach 10+ customers and break-even profitability by end of Year 2

What We're Saying No To:
- No to horizontal SMB play (too competitive; low margins)
- No to price-based competition (doesn't fit our strengths)
- No to internal product extension (requires separate focus)
- No to waiting (window will close; competitors moving)

Trade-Offs Accepted:
- Organizational complexity (separate product; separate GTM)
- Resource split (engineering and sales effort divided)
- Near-term profitability (investment in SMB)
- Narrower initial market (verticals vs. horizontal)

Key Assumptions Underlying Recommendation:
1. We can build SMB product in 6 months (ASSUMED; technical feasibility unclear)
2. Vertical expertise will command premium pricing (VALIDATED but limited data)
3. Market will adopt from startup (ASSUMED; adoption curves untested)
4. Competitors won't match our vertical focus (ASSUMED; possible but not certain)
5. Customer acquisition will follow our financial model (ASSUMED; depends on execution)

Assumptions Need Validation:
- Assumption 1: Test through pilot (build MVP; get feedback Month 3-4)
- Assumption 2: Validate through customer pricing testing (Month 2-3)
- Assumption 3: Validate through pilot customer acquisition (Month 7-9)
- Assumption 4: Monitor competitive intelligence (ongoing)
- Assumption 5: Track actual CAC vs. model (ongoing)

Go/No-Go Decision Points:
- Month 6: Product ready for pilot? (decision point)
- Month 9: Pilots showing positive adoption? (decision point)
- Month 12: Market launch shows traction? (decision point)
- If any "no": Reconsider strategy or pivot approach
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect direction certainty
- ❌ Exhaustive assumption documentation
- ❌ Risk-free path forward
- ❌ Unanimous agreement

### 4. Confidence & Credibility Are Assessed ✓

- [ ] **Overall confidence level is stated**
  - How confident are we in direction?
  - Would skeptic accept recommendation?
  - What's the confidence level (high/medium/low)?
  - Why that level?

- [ ] **Credibility of analysis is assessed**
  - Is analysis rigorous?
  - Were alternatives considered?
  - Were assumptions validated?
  - Is analysis defensible?

- [ ] **Limitations are acknowledged**
  - What don't we know?
  - What assumptions are unvalidated?
  - What could prove us wrong?
  - What additional work would increase confidence?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
CONFIDENCE & CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT:

Overall Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH

Factors Supporting High Confidence:
✓ Market gap validated across multiple phases
✓ Competitive threat is observable (competitors actively entering)
✓ Financial model is conservative (assumes below-market adoption)
✓ Vertical differentiation is clear and defensible
✓ Unit economics are strong (13:1 LTV:CAC)

Factors Limiting Full Confidence:
? Market adoption curves untested (assuming vs. measuring)
? Customer willingness to pay premium not fully validated (2-3 data points)
? Competitive response to our strategy unclear
? Product development timeline assumed (MVP build untested)
? GTM effectiveness uncertain (new sales model untested)

Credibility of Analysis:
Rigorous approach:
✓ DEFINE phase: Comprehensive problem definition; stakeholder input
✓ SPLIT phase: Hypothesis-driven analysis; testing validation
✓ ANALYSE phase: Multi-source validation; competitive analysis; financial modeling
✓ Cross-phase: Pattern analysis; assumption surfacing

Alternative Consideration:
? Price-based SMB strategy was considered and rejected (documented)
? Partnership approach was considered and rejected (documented)
? Horizontal SMB was considered and rejected (documented)
? Decision logic is defensible

Assumption Validation:
? Market gap: VALIDATED (competitive entry, customer feedback)
? Vertical opportunity: PARTIALLY VALIDATED (limited customer data)
? Financial model: ASSUMED (not yet tested in market)
? Execution feasibility: ASSUMED (product build not yet proven)
? Customer adoption: ASSUMED (real adoption curves untested)

Defensibility Against Skeptics:
"You're assuming adoption will be faster than industry average."
Response: We're modeling conservative adoption (1-2% Year 1); below average ramp
Support: Comparable companies show 1-2% initial adoption

"What if competitors match your vertical approach?"
Response: 18-month development lead; we'll own market during that window
Support: Vertical expertise takes time to build; first-mover advantage is real

"What if pricing doesn't hold at premium levels?"
Response: We have contingency; can adjust to $40-50K if needed
Support: Unit economics work at lower price; just slower path to profitability

Assessment: Analysis is defensible; skeptics would accept direction.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect confidence certainty
- ❌ All assumptions validated
- ❌ Addressed every possible skeptical question
- ❌ Risk-free recommendation

3. Create go-to-market strategy (how do we reach customers?)
4. Identify innovation opportunities (what else could we do?)
5. Develop narrative/messaging (how do we tell the story?)

INSIGHT Phase Deliverables:
- Competitive positioning strategy document
- Business model innovation options and recommendations
- Go-to-market strategy framework
- Innovation opportunity assessment

- External input: Customer calls (2-3); competitive expert review

---

Risks/Dependencies for INSIGHT:

Dependency 1: Market Adoption Curves
- Issue: INSIGHT will assume adoption model based on ANALYSE estimates
- Risk: If estimates are wrong, GTM strategy could be misaligned
- Mitigation: INSIGHT should validate adoption assumptions with customers

Dependency 2: Competitive Response Assumption
- Issue: INSIGHT assumes competitors won't match our vertical approach
- Risk: If competitors move faster, positioning becomes vulnerable
- Mitigation: Continuous competitive monitoring; prepare contingency positioning

Dependency 3: Pricing Assumption
- Issue: Financial model assumes $60-80K ACV can be sustained
- Risk: If market won't support premium pricing, margins suffer
- Mitigation: INSIGHT should test pricing with customer interviews

Dependency 4: Product Feasibility
- Issue: Assumes 6-month development timeline for MVP
- Risk: If product build slips, GTM and launch timeline slip
- Mitigation: INSIGHT should assume worst-case timeline; build contingency

All dependencies are documented for INSIGHT team awareness.

**What This Looks Like:**

```
DECISIONS MADE IN DEFINE PHASE:

Decision 1: Define Problem as Strategic Positioning Gap (Not Symptom)
Rationale: Customers weren't churning due to product quality or support; 
           they were churning because our positioning didn't address their needs
Alternatives Considered:
  - Frame as "pricing problem" → Too narrow; doesn't capture full issue
  - Frame as "execution problem" → Wrong root cause
Decision Maker: Strategic Analyst + Executive Sponsor
Timeline: Week 3 of DEFINE phase
Implications for SPLIT: Root cause analysis should explore positioning dynamics

Decision 2: Scope to 3 Verticals (Not All SMB)
Rationale: SMB market too broad; better to focus and dominate
Alternatives Considered:
  - Horizontal SMB approach → Too competitive; low margins
  - Single vertical initially → Too limiting; not enough market
Decision Maker: Strategic Analyst + Product Lead
Timeline: Week 4 of DEFINE phase
Implications for SPLIT: Hypothesis testing should validate if 3 verticals is optimal

Decision 3: Use Persona Handoff Approach for Knowledge Transfer
Rationale: Ensure knowledge doesn't get lost between phases
Alternatives Considered:
  - Single person leading all phases → Creates bottleneck
  - No structured handoff → Risk of context loss
Decision Maker: Orchestrator
Timeline: Week 1 of DEFINE phase
Implications for SPLIT: Specialist should use handoff to understand context

- [ ] **Path not taken is documented**
  - What did we not do?
  - Why not?
  - Could we revisit that path?
  - What would trigger reconsideration?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED & REJECTED:

Alternative 1: Address as Pricing Problem
Approach: Lower pricing to be competitive with SMB vendors
Rationale for rejection:
  - Interviews showed pricing wasn't the only issue
  - Feature gaps and positioning mismatch were equally important
  - Lowering price doesn't solve positioning problem
  - Would destroy enterprise premium positioning
What we learned: Problem is more complex than pricing; requires strategic response

Alternative 2: Serve SMB with Enterprise Product
Approach: Market existing enterprise product to SMB segment
Rationale for rejection:
  - Enterprise product too complex for SMB needs
  - Implementation time too long (120 days vs. needed 30 days)
  - Price point too high for SMB willing to pay
  - Would confuse brand (enterprise vs. SMB)
What we learned: Need separate product strategy; not just marketing adaptation

Alternative 3: Partner/Resell SMB Solution
Approach: Partner with SMB-focused vendor; white-label their solution
Rationale for rejection:
  - Loss of control over product roadmap
  - Customer relationships owned by partner
  - Revenue sharing reduces profitability
  - Strategic dependency on partner
What we learned: Need own product to maintain control and defensibility

Path Not Taken:
If we had pursued pricing-only approach, we would have:
- Missed root cause (positioning, not price)
- Damaged enterprise business
- Not addressed real customer need
Trigger for reconsideration: If vertical expertise strategy proves infeasible
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**

```
RISK ASSESSMENT SCOPE:

Initiative: SMB market entry (new product offering for small enterprises)

Timeframe: 18-month launch and initial scaling window
- Planning & development: Months 1-6
- Beta and pilot: Months 7-9
- Full market launch: Months 10-18
- Assessment covers full 18 months

Geographic Scope: North America (US + Canada)
- Focus on US market initially
- Canada expansion in year 2
- Risk assessment covers North American strategy

Aspects Included:
✓ Product development risks (can we build it?)
✓ Market risks (will customers buy?)
✓ Financial risks (will it be profitable?)
✓ Organizational risks (can we execute?)
✓ Competitive risks (will competitors respond?)

Aspects Excluded:
✗ International expansion (covered in separate assessment)
✗ Enterprise product risks (existing business, separate track)
✗ Corporate M&A risks (not relevant to this decision)

RISK CONTEXT:

Strategic Question: Should we enter the SMB market?
Decision Required: Executive decision on market entry (Month 2)
Investment Required: $8-12M in product development and go-to-market
At Stake: Market opportunity ($500M SAM); future growth; capital allocation
Context: Enterprise business is maturing; SMB represents growth opportunity

RISK APPETITE:

We are MEDIUM risk-tolerant for this initiative:
- Willing to take product risk (build new features; try new approach)
- Willing to take market risk (new market entry; customer acquisition risk)
- Willing to take competitive risk (compete with established players)

But NOT willing to accept:
- Risk to core enterprise business (must protect existing revenue)
- Risk of financial loss beyond $12M (capital limit)
- Risk of brand damage (must maintain premium positioning)
- Risk of people loss (must retain key talent)

Implication: Design SMB strategy to minimize risk to core business.

PROBABILITY & IMPACT ASSESSMENT:

Risk 1.1: Can't Build SMB Product in Timeline (6 months)

Probability Assessment:
- We've built enterprise product (done it before) → Lower probability
- This is new team/process/scope → Higher probability
- 6 months is aggressive timeline → Higher probability
- We have strong engineering → Lower probability
- Assessment: MEDIUM (30-50% chance)
- Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (based on comparable project experience)

Impact Assessment - If Delayed by 3 Months:
- Time-to-market: Pushed from Month 10 to Month 13
- Competitive impact: Competitors gain head start
- Revenue impact: Delay profitability 3 months (material)
- Strategic impact: Question viability; could kill initiative
- Overall impact: HIGH

Impact Assessment - If Delayed by 6+ Months:
- Time-to-market: Pushed beyond planning horizon
- Competitive impact: Competitors establish market leadership
- Revenue impact: Revenue delayed 6+ months; profitability in doubt
- Strategic impact: Initiative may not be viable
- Overall impact: CRITICAL

Assessment: MEDIUM probability × HIGH impact = MEDIUM-HIGH severity
Confidence in assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH

---

Risk 2.1: SMB Customers Want Lower Price Than Viable

Probability Assessment:
- Price sensitivity is known SMB characteristic → Higher probability
- We haven't tested pricing yet → Uncertainty
- Early customer feedback is mixed → Medium signal
- Competitors are priced $25-50K → Our $50K is on higher end
- Assessment: MEDIUM (40-60% chance pricing is barrier)
- Confidence: MEDIUM (limited market research; need validation)

Impact Assessment - If Price Barrier is Real:
Scenario A: Customers don't buy at our price
- Revenue impact: Significantly lower adoption
- Business viability: Questioned
- Impact: CRITICAL

Scenario B: We lower price to $35K
- Margin impact: 25% lower margin
- Profitability timeline: Extended 12+ months
- Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH

Scenario C: Mix of customers (some at $50K; some at $35K)
- Blended margin: 10-15% lower
- Profitability: Achievable but tighter
- Impact: MEDIUM

Assessment: MEDIUM probability × CRITICAL-TO-MEDIUM impact = MEDIUM-HIGH
Confidence in assessment: MEDIUM (untested; need customer validation)

Risk 4.1: Competitors Launch SMB Offering

Probability Assessment:
- Competitors are well-capitalized → Higher probability
- They have brand and sales force → Easier to launch
- SMB market is attractive → They'll see opportunity
- They're slower-moving historically → Lower probability (but still could happen)
- Assessment: HIGH (60-80% chance)
- Confidence: HIGH (based on competitive dynamics; logical inference)

Impact Assessment - If Competitor Launches:
Scenario A: They launch within 12 months
- Market timing: We get 6-month head start
- Competitive positioning: They have brand; we build installed base
- Market impact: Commoditization risk; price pressure
- Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (we can survive; harder to scale)

Scenario B: They launch within 6 months
- Market timing: We get 0-3 month head start
- Competitive positioning: Race to install base
- Market impact: Significant price/feature pressure
- Impact: HIGH (could undermine business case)

Assessment: HIGH probability × MEDIUM-HIGH impact = HIGH severity
Confidence in assessment: HIGH

### 4. Mitigation Approaches Are Outlined ✓

- [ ] **Mitigation strategies are defined for critical risks**
  - How would we prevent risk?
  - How would we detect it early?
  - How would we respond if it occurs?
  - Is mitigation realistic and feasible?

- [ ] **Mitigations are actionable**
  - Would someone know what to do?
  - Is mitigation specific (not vague)?
  - Can mitigation be executed?
  - Are resources available?

- [ ] **Residual risk is understood**
  - Even with mitigation, does risk remain?
  - Is residual risk acceptable?
  - What's the contingency if mitigation fails?
  - When would we escalate?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
MITIGATION APPROACHES FOR CRITICAL RISKS:

CRITICAL RISK: Competitors Launch SMB Offering

PREVENTION (How to prevent risk):
- Build strong differentiation (hard for them to copy)
  Approach: Vertical expertise positioning
  Timeline: Embed in product/go-to-market from Day 1
  Owner: Product + Marketing

- Get to market first (establish customer base before them)
  Approach: Accelerate timeline; focus on pilot customers
  Timeline: Month 10 launch (not later)
  Owner: Product + Sales

- Build customer loyalty (make switching hard)
  Approach: Deep vertical expertise; vertical integrations
  Timeline: Build into product strategy
  Owner: Product + Customer Success

Feasibility: MEDIUM-HIGH (realistic but requires flawless execution)

DETECTION (How to know risk is materializing):
- Competitive monitoring (weekly)
  What to watch: Product announcements, press releases, hiring
  Trigger: If competitor announces SMB product, escalate immediately

- Customer intelligence (monthly)
  What to watch: Customer mentions of competitor SMB offering
  Trigger: If 3+ customers mention seeing competitive offer, escalate

- Market intelligence (monthly)
  What to watch: Industry analyst coverage, market research
  Trigger: If analyst mention competitor SMB offering, review strategy

Feasibility: HIGH (easy to monitor)

RESPONSE (If risk occurs; how to respond):
Timeline Scenario: Competitor announces SMB product in Month 6

Immediate (Week 1):
- Assess competitor offering (product, positioning, pricing)
- Assess customer reaction (contact key prospects and customers)
- Assess impact to our business case
- Convene leadership to review strategy

Short-term (Month 1):
- Accelerate our launch if behind timeline
- Emphasize our vertical differentiation (vs. generic competitor)
- Lock in early customers with special terms if needed
- Plan pricing/positioning response if needed

Medium-term (Months 2-6):
- Execute flawlessly on product/market launch
- Build installed base faster than competitor
- Emphasize vertical expertise vs. competitor's horizontal approach
- Build customer loyalty through great execution

Contingency: If competitor moves so fast we can't compete:
- Pivot strategy (perhaps focus on adjacent vertical)
- Consider partnership/acquisition scenario
- Reassess business case

Feasibility: MEDIUM (depends on execution and timing)

Residual Risk After Mitigation:
- Even with mitigation, competitor could still outrun us
- Even with fast launch, they could still win share
- Even with differentiation, they could copy our approach
- Residual risk: MEDIUM (still a threat, but manageable)

Acceptable? YES (we accept this residual risk as cost of market entry)

---

HIGH RISK: Can't Build Product in Timeline

PREVENTION:
- Reduce scope to must-haves only
  Approach: Focus on 6 core workflows (not 10)
  Timeline: Define scope in Month 1
  Owner: Product

- Build experienced team (proven ability to execute fast)
  Approach: Hire lead engineer who's shipped fast before
  Timeline: Hire by Month 2
  Owner: CEO + VP Eng

- Use agile methodology (fast iteration, early feedback)
  Approach: Monthly demos to stakeholders; rapid iteration
  Timeline: Implement in Month 1
  Owner: VP Eng

Feasibility: HIGH (proven approaches; realistic)

DETECTION:
- Monthly milestone reviews
  Watch: Are we hitting development milestones?
  Trigger: If 2+ weeks behind schedule, escalate

- Customer feedback loops (early validation)
  Watch: Do early testers like what they're seeing?
  Trigger: If feedback is negative, reassess approach

Feasibility: HIGH (easy to track)

RESPONSE (If timeline slipping):
- Reduce scope further (cut lowest-value features)
- Add resources if available (burn capital to maintain timeline)
- Extend timeline (push launch to later month)
- Pivot to MVP approach (ship minimum; iterate later)

Feasibility: MEDIUM (some options possible; trade-offs exist)

Residual Risk:
- Even with mitigation, we might miss timeline
- Even with reduced scope, might take longer than planned
- Residual risk: MEDIUM (we can recover; not critical)

Acceptable? YES (we can live with Month 11 vs. Month 10 launch)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect mitigation plans
- ❌ Detailed contingency procedures
- ❌ Zero residual risk
- ❌ 100% mitigation effectiveness

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Assessment is Ready When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Risk scope is clearly defined
- Material risks are identified
- Probability and impact are assessed
- Mitigation approaches are outlined
- Monitoring and escalation are defined
- Documentation is clear

**Risk assessment can inform go/no-go decision.**

---

### 🔄 Assessment Needs More Work When

- **Scope unclear?** → Define initiative, timeframe, context
- **Risks incomplete?** → Brainstorm across risk categories; fill gaps
- **Assessments vague?** → Make probability/impact specific and justified
- **Mitigations weak?** → Develop stronger prevention/response
- **Monitoring undefined?** → Define specific metrics and triggers
- **Documentation confusing?** → Simplify; organize; add clarity

---

## Common Issues & Resolution

| Issue | Signal | Resolution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Too many risks** | "50+ risks identified" | Focus on material risks; combine minor ones |
| **Vague risks** | "Something could go wrong" | Make risks specific and observable |
| **No probability** | "Seems risky" | Ground in data; compare to historical |
| **No mitigation** | "We'll deal with it" | Develop specific prevention/response plans |
| **No escalation** | "When do we escalate?" | Define specific triggers and thresholds |
| **No accountability** | "Who's responsible?" | Assign owner to each critical risk |
| **Acceptance without plan** | "We'll live with this" | Have explicit contingency if mitigation fails |

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Risks Are Comprehensively Identified ✓

- [ ] **All major risk categories covered**
  - Strategic risks (market, competitive, positioning)
  - Financial risks (investment, revenue, margin)
  - Operational risks (execution, resources, capabilities)
  - Organizational risks (people, culture, focus)
  - External risks (regulatory, economic, tech)
  - Customer risks (satisfaction, retention, adoption)

- [ ] **Risks are specific, not generic**
  - Each risk is clearly articulated
  - Context for risk is provided
  - Risk could be understood by someone unfamiliar
  - Risk is testable/observable

- [ ] **Risk identification is thorough**
  - Would this survive challenge from skeptics?
  - Are obvious risks included?
  - Are subtle/hidden risks included?
  - Is there good coverage across areas?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
STRATEGIC RISKS:

Risk 1.1: SMB Market Adoption Slower Than Expected
Context: We're assuming 2% market capture by Year 3; if adoption
slower, we miss revenue targets
Probability: MEDIUM (market adoption risk is real; could be 1% vs. 2%)
Impact: HIGH (directly affects revenue and profitability)
Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH (could delay breakeven 6-12 months)

Risk 1.2: Competitor Moves Into SMB Market Faster
Context: Competitor X could launch SMB product faster than expected
Probability: MEDIUM (they have resources; timing uncertain)
Impact: HIGH (could establish market dominance before we scale)
Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH (could force pricing/feature pressure)

FINANCIAL RISKS:

Risk 2.1: Customer Acquisition Cost Higher Than Expected
Context: Assuming $8K CAC; if sales process less efficient, could be $10K+
Probability: MEDIUM (first-time entry to SMB channel)
Impact: MEDIUM (reduces profitability; extends payback)
Severity: MEDIUM (even at $10K CAC, still viable)

Risk 2.2: Gross Margin Lower Than Projected
Context: Assuming 75% margin; support costs could be higher for SMB
Probability: LOW (product margin typically stable; support could vary)
Impact: MEDIUM (directly reduces profitability)
Severity: MEDIUM (could delay profitability by 6 months)

ORGANIZATIONAL RISKS:

Risk 3.1: Can't Attract SMB Sales Talent
Context: SMB sales motion different from enterprise; may struggle to hire
Probability: MEDIUM (tight talent market; SMB skills different)
Impact: HIGH (can't execute without good sales leadership)
Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH (delays launch; impacts revenue)

Risk 3.2: Dual Focus Distracts From Enterprise Excellence
Context: Taking product/sales talent for SMB; could impact enterprise
Probability: MEDIUM-HIGH (focus is real; people have finite capacity)
Impact: MEDIUM (enterprise churn could increase)
Severity: MEDIUM (acceptable if we mitigate)

EXTERNAL RISKS:

Risk 4.1: Economic Downturn Impacts SMB Spending
Context: SMB segment more sensitive to economic cycles
Probability: MEDIUM (economic cycles happen; timing uncertain)
Impact: MEDIUM (could reduce customer spending)
Severity: MEDIUM (downside scenario already accounts for this)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Every possible risk
- ❌ Risks for non-strategic issues
- ❌ Risks that are truly hypothetical
- ❌ Paralysis from over-identification

---

### 2. Probability & Impact Are Assessed ✓

- [ ] **Probability is assessed realistically**
  - HIGH: Very likely to occur (>60% chance)
  - MEDIUM: Reasonable chance (30-60%)
  - LOW: Unlikely but possible (<30%)
  - Basis provided for each assessment

- [ ] **Impact is assessed on relevant dimensions**
  - Financial impact (cost, revenue, profitability)
  - Timing impact (delay, acceleration)
  - Strategic impact (competitive position, market opportunity)
  - Organizational impact (capability, morale)

- [ ] **Risk severity is prioritized**
  - High probability × High impact = Critical risks
  - High probability × Low impact = Annoying risks (lower priority)
  - Low probability × High impact = Catastrophic risks (if they happen)
  - Low probability × Low impact = Monitor risks

**What This Looks Like:**
```
RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX:

Risk                          | Prob | Impact | Severity | Priority
Slow SMB adoption             | MED  | HIGH   | MED-HIGH | CRITICAL
Competitor enters SMB         | MED  | HIGH   | MED-HIGH | CRITICAL
CAC higher than expected      | MED  | MED    | MEDIUM   | HIGH
Can't hire SMB sales talent   | MED  | HIGH   | MED-HIGH | CRITICAL
Dual focus harms enterprise   | MED-H| MED    | MEDIUM   | HIGH
Gross margin lower            | LOW  | MED    | LOW-MED  | MEDIUM
Economic downturn             | MED  | MED    | MEDIUM   | MEDIUM
Product bugs/quality issues   | LOW  | MED    | LOW-MED  | LOW

CRITICAL RISKS (Top Priority):
1. SMB market adoption slower than expected
2. Competitor moves into SMB faster
3. Can't attract SMB sales talent

HIGH RISKS (High Priority):
1. CAC higher than expected
2. Dual focus impacts enterprise

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:
"SMB adoption slower" - MEDIUM probability
Basis: Market data shows TAM is $2B; competitors are moving in;
customer feedback is positive. Probability 30-60% for slower adoption
would mean <1.5% capture vs. our 2% assumption.
Confidence: MEDIUM (market adoption is always uncertain)

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
"Competitor enters SMB faster" - HIGH impact
Basis: Would establish competitive position; force pricing pressure;
reduce our TAM. Impact would be 20-30% lower revenue potential.
Confidence: HIGH (competitive impact is clear)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Quantified probabilities (percentages okay, ranges fine)
- ❌ Mathematical severity scoring
- ❌ Perfect assessment accuracy
- ❌ Agreement from everyone

### 3. Mitigation Approaches Are Outlined ✓

- [ ] **Mitigation strategies identified for critical risks**
  - How would we prevent risk?
  - How would we detect risk early?
  - How would we respond if risk occurs?
  - Is mitigation realistic and feasible?

- [ ] **Mitigations are prioritized**

**What This Looks Like:**
```
CRITICAL RISK 1: SMB Market Adoption Slower Than Expected

Prevention:
- Conduct customer discovery with SMB prospects before full launch
- Validate product-market fit with pilot customers
- Research and validate market demand
Timeline: Month 1-3

Detection:
- Track pipeline velocity (customer interest level)
- Track trial-to-customer conversion rates
- Monthly pipeline reviews
Trigger: If conversion <20% (vs. 40% target), escalate

Response:
- Pause aggressive scaling if adoption slow
- Iterate on product/messaging based on feedback
- Consider pivot to different SMB segment
Timeline: If triggered at Month 6, would reassess by Month 9

Residual Risk: Even with mitigation, market adoption could be slow
Acceptable: YES (downside scenario already models 1% capture)
Contingency: If adoption not reaching 2%, would continue with 1%
and accept lower profitability; or pivot strategy

CRITICAL RISK 2: Competitor Enters SMB Market Faster

Prevention:
- Accelerate launch timeline (get to market faster)
- Build differentiated product/positioning
- Establish customer relationships early
Timeline: Month 1-6

Detection:
- Competitive monitoring (weekly)
- Sales intelligence from early customer conversations
- Industry tracking
Trigger: If competitor announces SMB product, immediately escalate

Response:
- Accelerate product features if feasible
- Emphasize differentiation in positioning
- Consider partnership/acquisition approach
Timeline: If triggered early, respond immediately

Residual Risk: Competitor may still move faster and establish position
Acceptable: YES (we have enterprise strength they lack)
Contingency: If competitor establishes dominance, pivot to
partnership or adjacent segment

CRITICAL RISK 3: Can't Attract SMB Sales Talent

Prevention:
- Start recruiting immediately (Month 1)
- Offer competitive comp package
- Get candidate from existing network
- Consider outside sales leader if internal available
Timeline: Month 1-3

Detection:
- Hiring progress tracking (weekly)
- Interview pipeline monitoring
- Time-to-fill metrics
Trigger: If no hire by Month 4, escalate

Response:
- Use recruiters if internal efforts stall
- Consider higher comp/equity to attract
- Look at partnerships/channel if internal sales harder
Timeline: If triggered, respond by Month 5

Residual Risk: SMB sales talent may not accept our comp/opportunity
Acceptable: YES (could use partners/channels as alternative)
Contingency: If internal sales hire not possible by Month 6,
pivot to partnership/channel GTM approach
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect mitigation plans
- ❌ Detailed contingency procedures
- ❌ Zero residual risk (some acceptable)
- ❌ Complete prevention strategies

  - What happens after escalation?

- [ ] **Governance is established**
  - Who reviews risk register?
  - How often are risks revisited?
  - How are changes communicated?
  - How do we learn from realized risks?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
RISK MONITORING APPROACH:

WEEKLY TRACKING:

- Competitive intelligence (monitoring for competitor moves)
- Team morale/retention (early warning of people risks)
- Owner: SMB Sales Lead + Product Lead
- Forum: Weekly steering committee

MONTHLY TRACKING:
- Customer adoption metrics (trial conversions, new customers)
- Financial actuals vs. forecast (revenue, CAC)
- Gross margin tracking (cost validation)
- Churn/retention metrics
- Owner: SMB GM (General Manager)
- Forum: Monthly executive review

QUARTERLY TRACKING:
- Market dynamics review (TAM changes, competitive landscape)
- Strategic assumption validation (are key assumptions holding?)
- Risk register review and update
- Owner: Strategy team
- Forum: Quarterly board presentation

ESCALATION TRIGGERS:

Trigger 1: Pipeline conversion <20% for 2 consecutive weeks
- Action: Review messaging/product with sample customers
- Escalate to: VP Product
- Timeline: Trigger analysis within 1 week

Trigger 2: New customer CAC running 20%+ higher than budget
- Action: Analyze sales process; identify cost drivers
- Escalate to: CFO
- Timeline: Trigger analysis within 1 week

Trigger 3: Enterprise customer churns unexpectedly
- Action: Root cause analysis; assess impact
- Escalate to: CEO
- Timeline: Immediate (within 1 day)

Trigger 4: Competitor launches SMB offering
- Action: Immediate competitive assessment
- Escalate to: CEO + Board
- Timeline: 24 hours

GOVERNANCE:

Monthly Risk Review:
- Existing risks reassessed (probability, impact, mitigation)

- Mitigation status reviewed
- Owner: Risk owner (assigned to each risk)
- Forum: Monthly leadership meeting

Quarterly Deep Dive:
- Trend analysis (are risks increasing, decreasing?)
- Mitigation effectiveness review

# Root Cause Analysis Quality Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that a completed root cause analysis has explored multiple cause layers, gathered adequate evidence, and mapped cause-effect relationships with sufficient rigor to support strategic decision-making.

## What Gets Validated

**Task Reference:** `tasks/root-cause-analysis.md`

**Used In:** SPLIT and ANALYSE phases for problem decomposition and validation

**Audience:** Strategic analysts, problem solvers, decision-makers determining if problem understanding is sufficient

---

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Problem Definition Is Clear & Bounded ✓

- [ ] **Problem is specifically stated, not symptom**
  - States the actual problem (not the visible effect)
  - Distinguishes root cause from symptoms
  - Problem is observable and measurable
  - Could be understood by someone unfamiliar with context

- [ ] **Problem scope is clearly defined**
  - What's included (in scope)?
  - What's excluded (out of scope)?
  - Why this boundary makes sense?
  - Are scope boundaries defensible?

- [ ] **Problem quantification is attempted**
  - How large is the problem?
  - Who/what is affected?
  - What's the business impact?
  - Timeline (when did it start, is it growing)?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
SYMPTOM vs. ROOT CAUSE:

Symptom: "Customers are churning"
Root Cause Focus: Why are they churning? (Could be: pricing,
feature gaps, poor support, competitive pressure, market shift)

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
"Enterprise customers with <$100K annual contract value are
churning at 18% annually, compared to 3% churn for customers
with >$500K ACV. This represents $2.8M in lost ARR annually.
Churn accelerated 6 months ago and is trending worse. This is
specifically our enterprise segment, not SMB."

SCOPE:
In Scope: Enterprise customer churn; enterprise product/service
Out of Scope: SMB customer churn; sales pipeline; product quality
Why: Enterprise churn is our current business threat; SMB is
separate market segment we're not serving at scale

QUANTIFICATION:
- 18% annual churn rate (12 customers churned this year out of 67)
- Represents $2.8M lost ARR
- Started accelerating 6 months ago (was ~8% before)
- Currently trending at 24% annualized if pattern continues
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect scoping (reasonable boundaries sufficient)
- ❌ Complete precision (estimates acceptable)
- ❌ Agreement from all stakeholders
- ❌ Solution-focused scoping

---

### 2. Multiple Cause Layers Explored ✓

- [ ] **Surface causes identified (obvious factors)**
  - What's the most obvious cause?
  - Who thinks the problem is caused by what?
  - What do affected people blame?
  - Are these hypotheses documented?

- [ ] **Underlying causes explored (dig deeper)**
  - Why does that surface cause exist?
  - What enables that cause to occur?
  - Are there patterns or systemic factors?
  - Have you asked "Why?" at least 3 times?

- [ ] **Root causes identified (fundamental drivers)**
  - What's the core issue causing multiple surface symptoms?
  - Is this cause within our ability to address?
  - Would addressing this reduce problem?
  - Is this the deepest layer needed?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
CUSTOMER CHURN ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

SURFACE CAUSES (What customers say):
- "Your pricing is too high" (stated in exit interviews)
- "We found a better solution" (competitive pressure)
- "You didn't listen to feature requests" (product gaps)

UNDERLYING CAUSES (Dig deeper - Why?):

Why is our pricing high?
→ Our cost structure (premium support, enterprise features)
→ Our positioning (premium/enterprise focused)
→ Our decision to target enterprise first (intentional strategy)

Why is product missing features?
→ Enterprise features are complex; SMB features are simple
→ We prioritized enterprise roadmap
→ We didn't have SMB customers to validate SMB features
→ Product team focused on depth, not breadth

Why are competitors winning?
→ They built simpler, cheaper solutions for enterprise-like-SMB
→ They entered market faster (more agile)
→ They built for "good enough" not "best-in-class"
→ Our enterprise customers wanted both (premium + affordable)

ROOT CAUSES (Fundamental drivers):

Root Cause 1: STRATEGIC POSITIONING
- We positioned ourselves as premium/enterprise-only
- This created price umbrella that invited competitive pressure
- We optimized for enterprise; left SMB-like-enterprise segment exposed

Root Cause 2: MARKET MISALIGNMENT
- Large enterprise customers ($500K+ ACV) are happy (3% churn)
- Smaller enterprise customers ($100K ACV) want enterprise features
  at SMB pricing (inconsistent expectations)
- We can't serve both profitably with single product

Root Cause 3: COMPETITIVE TIMING
- Competitors spotted the gap (premium features, SMB pricing)
- They launched simplified versions specifically targeting this segment
- We didn't see it coming (our focus on large enterprise blinded us)
- Now they're winning the mid-market customers we previously owned

ROOT CAUSE EVIDENCE:
- Exit interviews: 8 of 12 churned customers cited pricing
- Competitive analysis: Competitors launched products 18 months ago
- Product data: Small enterprise customers used 40% of features
- Financial data: Small enterprise segment less profitable
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect cause identification
- ❌ Unanimous agreement on causes
- ❌ Exhaustive list of every possible cause
- ❌ Formal 5-Why analysis (structured thinking sufficient)

---

### 3. Evidence Is Gathered & Referenced ✓

- [ ] **Evidence sources are identified**
  - What data was reviewed?
  - Who was interviewed?
  - What research was conducted?
  - Are sources documented?

- [ ] **Evidence supports cause hypotheses**
  - Does evidence link to stated causes?
  - Is evidence credible and reliable?
  - Are alternative explanations considered?
  - Is there counterevidence?

- [ ] **Confidence levels are stated**
  - How confident are we in each cause?
  - What evidence is strong vs. weak?
  - What assumptions are being made?
  - What would increase/decrease confidence?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
EVIDENCE GATHERING & ASSESSMENT:

Evidence Source 1: Exit Interviews
- Data: 15 exit interviews with churned customers
- Finding: 8 cited pricing; 4 cited feature gaps; 3 cited service
- Confidence: HIGH (direct from customers; multiple sources)
- Limitation: Only 12 of 67 customers interviewed (rest not available)
- Implication: Pricing is primary churn driver for departing customers

Evidence Source 2: Competitive Intelligence
- Data: Competitive pricing analysis; product feature comparison
- Finding: 3 competitors launched SMB-focused versions in 2024
- Confidence: HIGH (public announcements; customer feedback confirms)
- Limitation: Don't know their market share/traction
- Implication: Competitive window is real; timing is urgent

Evidence Source 3: Product Usage Data
- Data: Feature usage analysis for churned vs. retained customers
- Finding: Churned customers used 35% of features; retained use 55%
- Confidence: MEDIUM (depends on data accuracy; may have usage bias)
- Limitation: Doesn't prove causation (could be selection effect)
- Implication: Feature depth may not be valued by small enterprise

Evidence Source 4: Financial Modeling
- Data: CAC, LTV, margin by customer segment
- Finding: $100K ACV segment has 3-year LTV of $280K; CAC $35K
- Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (depends on data accuracy)
- Limitation: Forward-looking model; not historical validation
- Implication: Small enterprise segment is viable but tight economics

Evidence Source 5: Market Research
- Data: Third-party analyst reports (Gartner, industry reports)
- Finding: Mid-market (SMB-like-enterprise) growing 25% annually
- Confidence: MEDIUM (secondary research; may be outdated)
- Limitation: 18 months old; market may have shifted
- Implication: Market opportunity is real but may have consolidated

GAPS & UNCERTAINTIES:
- Haven't directly tested if lower pricing would stop churn
- Haven't validated if competitors are winning these customers
- Don't have reliable competitive win/loss data
- Market research may be outdated

CONFIDENCE SUMMARY:
Cause: Strategic positioning & market gap exposure
Confidence: HIGH (multiple evidence sources converge)

Cause: Competitive timing catching us off-guard
Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (evidence is indirect; could have other factors)

Cause: Product not optimized for mid-market
Confidence: MEDIUM (evidence suggests this but not proven)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Exhaustive evidence gathering
- ❌ Quantified confidence scores
- ❌ Perfect data quality
- ❌ Elimination of all uncertainty

### 4. Cause-Effect Relationships Are Mapped ✓

- [ ] **Causes are connected to effects logically**
  - How does this cause produce this effect?
  - Is the mechanism clear?
  - Would the mechanism work in practice?
  - Could someone understand it?

- [ ] **Chain of causation is traced**
  - What's the sequence: Root cause → Intermediate → Symptom?
  - Are intermediate steps identified?
  - Does sequence make logical sense?
  - Are there feedback loops?

- [ ] **Multiple causes vs. single cause is clear**
  - Is problem caused by one root cause or many?
  - If many, how do they interact?
  - Which is most important?
  - Are dependencies between causes identified?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
CAUSE-EFFECT MAPPING:

ROOT CAUSE → MECHANISM → EFFECT

ROOT CAUSE: Strategic positioning as "premium enterprise-only"

MECHANISM & CHAIN:
1. We positioned as premium enterprise solution
2. This required higher pricing to fund feature depth
3. Smaller enterprise customers ($100K ACV) found price too high
4. Competitors noticed this gap (premium features wanted at SMB pricing)
5. Competitors built SMB-focused versions and targeted mid-market
6. Small enterprise customers saw alternative (better value)
7. Price pressure + better-value alternative → Churn

EFFECTS OBSERVED:
- High churn in <$200K ACV segment (18% annual)
- Low churn in >$500K ACV segment (3% annual)
- Competitive pressure in mid-market
- Margin pressure on smaller deals

CAUSE INTERACTION MAP:

Strategic Positioning (premium/enterprise)
    ↓ Creates
    ├─→ High Pricing Strategy
    │      ↓ Attracts
    │      └─→ Large Enterprise (happy, retained)
    │
    │      ↓ Creates Problem For
    │      └─→ Small Enterprise (price sensitive, churning)
    │
    ├─→ Product Complexity
    │      ↓ Attracts
    │      ├─→ Large Enterprise (wants depth)
    │      │
    │      ↓ Creates Problem For
    │      └─→ Small Enterprise (too complex, too much)
    │
    └─→ Market Gap
           ↓ Discovered By
           └─→ Competitors
                  ↓ Launch
                  └─→ Simplified Alternatives
                         ↓ Appeal To
                         └─→ Small Enterprise (better value)
                                ↓ Result
                                └─→ CHURN

PRIMARY CAUSE: Strategic positioning created pricing/feature gap
SECONDARY CAUSE: Competitors filled gap we left open
ENABLING CONDITION: Small enterprise segment willing to switch

MOST IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS: Strategic positioning decision
Could address by: Dual product strategy OR accept small enterprise loss
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect visual diagrams
- ❌ Quantified relationships
- ❌ Complete interaction models
- ❌ Mathematical formalization

---

### 5. Alternative Explanations Considered ✓

- [ ] **Alternative causes are identified**
  - What else could cause this?
  - What would other stakeholders blame?
  - Are there competing theories?
  - Have you stress-tested causes?

- [ ] **Alternatives are evaluated against evidence**
  - Do alternatives explain the evidence?
  - Are there gaps in alternative explanations?
  - Which explanation fits evidence best?
  - Is one more credible than others?

- [ ] **Causes are defensible against challenge**
  - Would skeptics accept this analysis?
  - Are there obvious counter-arguments?
  - Would other experts agree?
  - Is reasoning sound?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS EVALUATED:

Alternative 1: "Poor product quality is driving churn"
Evidence Against:
- Enterprise customers with same product have 3% churn (satisfied)
- Exit interviews don't cite product quality as issue
- NPS data shows product satisfaction is strong
Verdict: Not primary cause (but could be secondary factor)
Confidence: LOW that quality is main cause

Alternative 2: "Support/service is inadequate"
Evidence Against:
- Enterprise customers (same support) have low churn
- Exit interviews don't cite support as primary issue
- Support team size scales with customer base
Verdict: Possible but not primary cause
Confidence: LOW that service is main cause

Alternative 3: "Market is saturated, not competitor pressure"
Evidence Against:
- Market is growing at 25% annually (not saturated)
- Competitors are new entrants (19-24 months old)
- Churn timing aligns with competitor launches
Verdict: Unlikely; evidence points to competitive pressure
Confidence: MEDIUM that saturation is significant factor

Alternative 4: "Customers have wrong expectations set in sales"
Evidence Against:
- Enterprise customers (same sales process) have low churn
- Exit interviews cite pricing/features, not unmet expectations
- Product demos and trials showed what customers would get
Verdict: Possible but not primary cause
Confidence: LOW that sales misalignment is main cause

Most Credible Explanation:
Strategic positioning + competitive gap + market timing
This best explains:
✓ Why large enterprise stays (aligned expectations/value)
✓ Why small enterprise leaves (misaligned value/price)
✓ Why timing is sudden (competitors just entered)
✓ Why exit interviews cite pricing/features
✓ Why competitor pressure is accelerating

Alternative explanations don't adequately explain all observations.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Evaluation of every possible alternative
- ❌ Perfect elimination of alternatives
- ❌ Unanimous stakeholder agreement
- ❌ Formal statistical testing

  - Are confidence levels clear?

- [ ] **Limitations are acknowledged**
  - What's uncertain?
  - What would increase confidence?
  - What risks could this analysis miss?
  - What should be validated further?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS CONCLUSIONS:

FINAL ROOT CAUSE STATEMENT:
"Customer churn in the $100K-$250K ACV segment is driven by
strategic positioning mismatch: we positioned as premium enterprise
solution (complex features, high price), but this segment wants
enterprise-class quality at SMB-friendly pricing. Competitors filled
this gap, creating attractive alternative. Without repositioning or
product change, churn will continue."

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (Flow from causes):
1. Strategic Decision (addresses root cause #1: positioning)
   → Decide: Stay premium-only OR pursue dual-segment strategy

2. If Dual-Segment Decision:
   → Build SMB-focused product (addresses root cause #2: gap)
   → Launch before competitors consolidate (addresses cause #3: timing)

3. Product Action (addresses product gap):
   → Simplify feature set for mid-market
   → Reduce support complexity
   → Create pricing tier for SMB

4. Go-to-Market Action (addresses competitive positioning):
   → Differentiate from competitors
   → Establish SMB brand/positioning
   → Build customer relationships early

LIMITATION: Churn in other causes not addressed
- If product quality IS issue in some cases, actions above miss that
- If support IS issue in some cases, actions above miss that
- Recommend gathering more evidence from specific churn cases

ASSUMPTIONS:
- Competitors are actually capturing these customers (assumed but not verified)
- Pricing elasticity is real (lower price would reduce churn)
- Dual-segment strategy is operationally feasible

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Root cause analysis is sound and logic is defensible
- Evidence supports conclusion but gaps remain
- Further validation recommended before major investment
- Recommend testing with small cohort before full execution

NEXT STEPS FOR VALIDATION:
1. Win/loss analysis: Are competitors winning these customers?
2. Pricing elasticity test: Lower pricing for sample; measure effect
3. Product validation: Do SMB features reduce churn?
4. Feasibility study: Can we build/support dual products?
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect certainty
- ❌ Elimination of all assumptions
- ❌ Complete validation
- ❌ Risk-free recommendations

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Analysis is Ready When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Problem definition is clear and bounded
- Multiple cause layers explored
- Evidence gathered and referenced
- Cause-effect relationships mapped
- Alternative explanations considered
- Analysis conclusions are sound

**Analysis can guide strategic decision-making.**

---

### 🔄 Analysis Needs More Work When

- **Problem unclear?** → Redefine problem more specifically
- **Causes unexplored?** → Dig deeper; ask "Why?" more times
- **No evidence?** → Gather data; interview stakeholders
- **Relationships vague?** → Map cause-effect more clearly
- **Alternatives ignored?** → Consider competing explanations
- **Conclusions weak?** → Strengthen logic; support better

---

## Common Issues & Resolution

| Issue | Signal | Resolution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Symptom vs. Root Cause** | "That's just what we see" | Keep asking "Why?" until you find underlying driver |
| **Single-layer analysis** | "Because customers prefer competitors" | Dig into WHY customers prefer competitors |
| **No evidence** | "Everyone knows this is true" | Find data; interview people; verify beliefs |
| **Weak mechanism** | "This causes that but not clear how" | Explain the causal chain step-by-step |
| **Ignored alternatives** | "We didn't consider other causes" | Evaluate competing explanations |
| **Too confident** | "We're 100% sure this is the cause" | Acknowledge uncertainty; state confidence level |
| **Jumps to solution** | "So we should do X" | First confirm root cause; then solution follows |

---

## Post-Validation Actions

Once this checklist passes:

1. **Document Final Root Cause Statement**
   - Create concise, clear statement of root cause
   - Include brief rationale
   - State confidence level
   - Note key assumptions

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Solution Directly Addresses Root Causes ✓

- [ ] **Solution targets identified root causes**
  - Does solution address the core problem (not symptom)?
  - Would fixing solution actually solve problem?
  - Are root causes directly addressed?
  - Would skeptic accept solution logic?

- [ ] **Solution logic is clear**
  - How does solution fix root cause?
  - What's the mechanism of change?
  - Why would this work?
  - Could be explained simply?

- [ ] **Alternative solutions were considered**
  - Were other approaches explored?
  - Why was this solution chosen?
  - What trade-offs were made?
  - Are alternatives documented?

**What This Looks Like:**

```
ROOT CAUSE vs. SOLUTION:

Root Cause Identified: "SMB market gap exists; competitors filling it"
  (Not: "Customers are churning")
  (Not: "We're not competitive")

Solution 1: Build separate SMB product
- Logic: Address market gap by building product for SMB
- Why it works: Competes directly in gap competitors filled
- Trade-off: Resource split; complexity; longer development
- Assessment: Directly addresses root cause ✓

Solution 2: Lower pricing on existing product
- Logic: Make existing product affordable for SMB
- Why it works: Removes price barrier; competes on value
- Trade-off: Margin compression; possible brand damage
- Assessment: Partially addresses (removes price barrier; not full gap)

Solution 3: Partner with implementer for SMB
- Logic: Partner delivers simplified implementation
- Why it works: Addresses complexity; provides SMB solution
- Trade-off: Revenue sharing; less direct control
- Assessment: Partially addresses (removes complexity; not full gap)

Recommended: Solution 1 (most directly addresses root cause)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect logic proof
- ❌ Exhaustive alternatives analysis
- ❌ Unanimous stakeholder agreement
- ❌ Guaranteed success

  - Validation: "Supported if 60%+ of SMB churn cite price; refuted if less than 20%"

- **Hypothesis 2 (High Impact/Lower Probability):** "Product gaps in mobile experience drive enterprise churn"
  - Test: Feature gap analysis; NPS analysis by customer type; interviews
  - Validation: "Supported if mobile is top 3 pain point for 40%+ enterprise customers"

**What This Does NOT Require:**

  - → Define validation criteria

- **Analysis approach undefined?**
  - → Identify what analyses are needed
  - → Sequence them logically
  - → Estimate effort and feasibility

- **Root causes not theorized?**
  - → Use root-cause-analysis task
  - → Consider multiple perspectives
  - → Distinguish likely from possible causes

---

## What This Phase DOES Include

✅ Problem decomposition (MECE structure)
✅ Hypothesis formation and prioritization
✅ Testable hypotheses with validation criteria

## Common Blockers & How to Resolve

| Blocker | Signal | Resolution |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Narrative feels data-heavy** | "Too many numbers" | Weave evidence into story; don't append analysis |
| **No emotional resonance** | "It's interesting but who cares?" | Add examples, customer stories, real impact |
| **Too many messages** | "We have 15 key messages" | Ruthlessly consolidate; focus on 3-5 core |

# Strategic Brief Validation Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that a completed Strategic Brief contains all essential sections with sufficient depth and clarity to serve as the executive summary of strategic work. This checklist ensures the brief can stand alone as a comprehensive strategic document.

## What Gets Validated

**Template Reference:** `templates/strategic-brief-tmpl.md`

**Used In:** DEFINE, STORY, and DECIDE phases as final executive summary

**Audience:** Executives, board, key stakeholders who need complete strategic picture without reading full analysis

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Executive Summary ✓

- [ ] **Opening paragraph captures full strategic situation**
  - What's the business challenge or opportunity?
  - Why does it matter (business impact)?
  - What's the strategic question being addressed?
  - Can someone understand the situation from this alone?

- [ ] **1-2 page summary is scannable**
  - Bold headers break up text
  - Key findings highlighted
  - Not dense paragraphs (bullets where appropriate)
  - Length is truly brief (1-2 pages maximum)

- [ ] **Tone is executive-appropriate**
  - Professional and credible
  - Evidence-based (not speculative)
  - Action-oriented (not descriptive)
  - Clear and direct (not academic)

**What This Looks Like:**
```
SITUATION:
We're experiencing 15% annual customer churn in our SMB segment,
representing $5M in lost ARR. Competitors are moving aggressively
downmarket with simplified, lower-cost offerings. Simultaneously,
our enterprise segment is highly stable (95% retention, $15M ARR)
with strong growth potential.

STRATEGIC QUESTION:
Should we expand into the SMB segment with a separate offering,
or maintain our focus on enterprise excellence?

KEY FINDINGS:
- SMB churn is driven primarily by pricing (60%) and feature gaps (30%)
- Enterprise customers are highly satisfied and loyal
- Market opportunity in SMB is substantial ($2B TAM; 25% annual growth)
- Competitors are establishing SMB presence; window may be time-limited
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Complete detailed analysis
- ❌ All supporting data
- ❌ Every finding detailed
- ❌ Polished presentation formatting

---

### 2. Problem/Opportunity Statement ✓

- [ ] **Problem is clearly and specifically stated**
  - Not vague or abstract
  - Business impact is quantified
  - Scope boundaries are defined
  - Root causes are indicated (without full analysis)

- [ ] **Problem statement could be understood by anyone**
  - Technical jargon is minimized
  - Context is provided where needed
  - Not assuming prior knowledge
  - Clarity over perfection

- [ ] **Problem connects to business strategy**
  - Why does this matter to the company?
  - How does it relate to strategic priorities?
  - What's at stake if not addressed?
  - Why now?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
We face a strategic inflection point. Our enterprise-focused
positioning has been highly successful ($15M ARR, 95% retention),
but it's left a significant market opportunity on the table. The SMB
segment we're not serving ($2B market, 25% growth) is being captured
by competitors with lower-cost, simpler offerings. Meanwhile, churn
in our existing SMB customers ($5M ARR) is running at 15% annually—
double our enterprise rate—primarily due to pricing misalignment.

STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:
This is not a tactical problem (which we could solve with pricing
tweaks). It's a strategic choice about whether we defend our
premium, enterprise-only positioning or leverage our success to
capture a larger market opportunity. The window for response is
limited—competitive positioning suggests 12-18 months before the
SMB market consolidates around fewer players.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Root cause proof (just indication)
- ❌ Complete market analysis
- ❌ Multiple perspectives
- ❌ Detailed financial impact

---

### 3. Key Findings (Evidence-Based) ✓

- [ ] **Major findings are stated clearly**
  - What did analysis reveal?
  - Each finding is specific (not general)
  - Findings are supported by evidence
  - Findings connect to problem statement

- [ ] **Evidence for findings is provided**
  - Data/research backing finding cited
  - Confidence level indicated (proven, strong, moderate, exploratory)
  - Limitations acknowledged if relevant
  - Assumptions stated if used

- [ ] **Findings tell a coherent story**
  - They build on each other logically
  - Together they explain the situation
  - They point toward decision needed
  - They're not random facts

**What This Looks Like:**
```
KEY FINDINGS:

1. SMB CHURN IS DRIVEN BY PRICING MISALIGNMENT (High Confidence)
   Finding: SMB customers churn because we're 25-30% more expensive
   than primary competitors; exit interviews showed price cited as
   primary reason in 80% of churned accounts.
   Evidence: Internal churn data (CRM); 15 exit interviews;
   competitive pricing analysis
   Confidence: HIGH (internal data validated by multiple sources)

2. ENTERPRISE SEGMENT IS HIGHLY STABLE (High Confidence)
   Finding: Enterprise customers are highly satisfied (NPS 75+)
   and very loyal (95% retention); they value advanced features
   and support quality over cost.
   Evidence: Internal retention/NPS data; enterprise customer interviews
   Confidence: HIGH (clear trend in data)

3. SMB MARKET OPPORTUNITY IS SUBSTANTIAL (Moderate Confidence)
   Finding: SMB addressable market is ~$2B; market is growing at
   25% annually; competitors are consolidating around simplified
   feature sets.
   Evidence: Third-party market research (18 months old);
   customer feedback; competitive analysis
   Confidence: MODERATE (secondary research; may have aged)

4. COMPETITIVE WINDOW IS TIME-LIMITED (Moderate Confidence)
   Finding: Competitors are establishing SMB presence aggressively;
   market may consolidate within 12-18 months, making entry harder.
   Evidence: Competitive monitoring; customer feedback about
   competitor offers; market trends
   Confidence: MODERATE (based on pattern observation, not definitive)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Exhaustive findings list
- ❌ Complete supporting data
- ❌ Perfect confidence levels
- ❌ All methodologies detailed

---

### 4. Strategic Implications & Insights ✓

- [ ] **"So what?" is clearly articulated**
  - What do findings mean for strategy?
  - What strategic choices are emerging?
  - What are we learning about market position?
  - What does this suggest about future?

- [ ] **Trade-offs are made visible**
  - What do we gain with each strategic option?
  - What do we give up?
  - What are we choosing between?
  - Why are trade-offs important?

- [ ] **Opportunities are identified**
  - What becomes possible with this understanding?
  - Where is growth opportunity?
  - What competitive advantage emerges?
  - What could we do that competitors can't?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:

Our analysis reveals a strategic inflection point: we have successfully
dominated the enterprise market, but in doing so, we've become a premium
player with limited ability to capture the adjacent, larger SMB market.
This isn't a problem to be fixed with tactics; it's a strategic choice.

CHOICE POINT 1: Market Focus
- OPTION A: Defend our premium, enterprise-only positioning
  Gain: Simplicity; maximize enterprise profitability; clear focus
  Give Up: $2B market opportunity; future growth; market share

- OPTION B: Pursue dual-segment strategy (enterprise + SMB)
  Gain: Larger market opportunity; growth potential; market leadership
  Give Up: Organizational simplicity; resource split; near-term profitability

OPPORTUNITY:
If we can serve both enterprise and SMB profitably with distinct
offerings, we could double our addressable market and achieve
market leadership position. Enterprise excellence becomes our
strength; SMB value becomes our reach.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
We have something competitors don't: proven enterprise success
(retention, NPS, product quality). We could leverage that to move
downmarket with confidence—taking best practices from enterprise
and adapting them for SMB simplicity/affordability.
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Final recommendation
- ❌ Detailed implementation approach
- ❌ Complete strategic analysis
- ❌ Quantified opportunity sizing

---

### 5. Recommendations or Framing for Decision ✓

- [ ] **Clear recommendation OR clear decision framing**

  - Rationale is clear and defensible
  - Recommendation connects to findings

- [ ] **Next steps are articulated**
  - What should happen next?
  - Who decides?
  - What's timeline for decision?
  - What work happens while deciding?

- [ ] **Success criteria are outlined**
  - What does success look like for recommended approach?
  - What metrics matter?
  - What's the target timeframe?
  - How will we measure success?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
RECOMMENDATION:
Pursue a dual-segment strategy with distinct enterprise and SMB
offerings. Rationale: This approach leverages our proven enterprise
strength, captures the substantial SMB opportunity before market
consolidates, and creates defensible market leadership position.

ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED:
Enterprise-only focus offers simplicity but leaves significant market
opportunity to competitors. Risk: competitors establish SMB dominance;
we become legacy enterprise player.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Executive decision on strategic direction (this month)
2. If approved, detailed planning for dual-segment execution
   (next quarter)
3. Phase 1 execution: Foundation (Months 1-6)
4. Phase 2 execution: Launch and scale (Months 6-18)

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Enterprise: Maintain $15M+ ARR, >90% retention, NPS >75
- SMB: Reach $10M ARR by Year 2, >80% retention
- Combined: Path to $40M ARR by Year 3; profitability >40%
- Competitive: Establish market leadership in both segments

### 5. Discovery Insights Documented ✓

- [ ] **Key discovery findings captured**
  - What did discovery conversation reveal?
  - What surprised us?
  - What themes emerged?
  - What points to investigate?

- [ ] **Customer/stakeholder voice included**
  - What did users/customers say?
  - What are they most concerned about?
  - What patterns emerged?
  - Are quotes/examples provided?

- [ ] **Red flags or opportunities noted**
  - What should we watch for?
  - What opportunities emerged?
  - What concerns were raised?
  - What areas need focus?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
KEY DISCOVERY FINDINGS:

Finding 1: SMB Customer Dissatisfaction Pattern
- Multiple SMB customers mentioned pricing as primary concern
- Described our solution as "enterprise-grade for SMB needs"
- Expressed frustration with feature complexity
- Noted competitors offer simpler, cheaper alternatives
Implication: SMB market willing to trade advanced features for simplicity/price

Finding 2: Enterprise Customer Strength
- Enterprise customers express high satisfaction
- Specifically value integration breadth and customization
- NPS scores are strong (75+)
- Long-term contracts and expansion deals common
Implication: Enterprise positioning is winning; don't lose focus

Finding 3: Market Dynamics Shift
- Multiple sources mentioned competitor downmarket moves
- Customer advisory board flagged competitive threat in SMB
- Competitive landscape consolidating around two tiers
Implication: Window for SMB entry may be time-limited

Finding 4: Product-Market Fit Questions
- SMB customers asking for simplified feature sets
- Enterprise customers want advanced features and customization
- Same product serving both seems challenging
Implication: May need separate product/positioning for SMB

CUSTOMER VOICE:

Quote from Churned SMB Customer:
"You're great for enterprise, but you're overkill for what we need. We'd
pay $500/month, not $5K/month. We found a competitor that gives us 80%
of the features at 20% of the cost."

Quote from Enterprise Customer:
"Your integration ecosystem is why we chose you. We need 15+ integrations
to work seamlessly. Most of your competitors can't do this."

Quote from Sales Team:
"We're losing SMB deals to Competitor Z on price every week. They're not
as capable, but they're 'good enough' and cheap. We can't compete on price
with our current positioning."

RED FLAGS:

Flag 1: Organizational capability concern
- Building/supporting dual-segment business is different from
  current enterprise focus
- Team has enterprise DNA; SMB is different
- Execution risk is real

Flag 2: Timing concern
- Market window for SMB entry estimated at 12-18 months
- Competitive moves happening now
- Decision timeline is critical

OPPORTUNITIES:

Opportunity 1: Leverage enterprise strength
- Our enterprise success is competitive advantage in SMB
- We could position as "enterprise-grade reliability for SMB simplicity"
- Reference customers could help SMB sales

Opportunity 2: Build integration ecosystem for SMB
- SMB increasingly wants integrations
- If we could provide 10-15 key integrations at SMB price point,
  would be compelling
- Different from enterprise integration depth
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Complete discovery notes
- ❌ All customer interviews transcribed
- ❌ Exhaustive stakeholder feedback
- ❌ Perfect organization of insights

# Strategic Decision Matrix Validation Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that a completed Strategic Decision Matrix provides a rigorous framework for evaluating strategic options with clear criteria, transparent scoring, and defensible recommendations.

## What Gets Validated

**Template Reference:** `templates/strategic-decision-matrix.md`

**Used In:** DECIDE phase for systematic option evaluation

**Audience:** Executives, decision-makers evaluating strategic alternatives

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Decision Question is Clear ✓

- [ ] **Decision being made is explicit**
  - What exactly are we deciding?
  - Is decision clearly stated?
  - Is decision specific (not vague)?
  - Would different people understand same decision?

- [ ] **Context for decision provided**
  - Why is this decision needed now?
  - What prompted the decision?
  - What's at stake?
  - What's the timeline?

- [ ] **Decision authority clear**
  - Who will make final decision?
  - When will decision be made?
  - What input is needed?
  - What happens after decision?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
DECISION BEING MADE:
"Should we enter the SMB market segment, and if so, how?"

CONTEXT:
- Current state: Enterprise-focused, highly profitable
- Problem: SMB segment is large ($2B) and growing; competitors
  moving downmarket; our SMB customers churning at 15%
- Opportunity: Could serve both enterprise and SMB profitably
- Timing: Market window for SMB entry is 12-18 months before
  competitors consolidate market
- Risk: Dual focus could distract from enterprise excellence

DECISION AUTHORITY:
- Decision-maker: CEO (with Board input)
- Timeline: This month
- Input needed: Executive leadership perspectives; Board guidance
- Next step: If approved, detailed execution planning
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Complete context (summary sufficient)
- ❌ Detailed decision tree
- ❌ Complete stakeholder input

---

### 2. Strategic Options are Distinct & Complete ✓

- [ ] **All viable options identified**
  - What are real strategic choices?
  - Are options meaningfully different?
  - Is "do nothing" option included?
  - Are there any other viable paths?

- [ ] **Options are clearly described**
  - What specifically would each option mean?
  - What would be required to execute?

  - Is timing of decision right? (Can we revisit later?)

**What This Looks Like:**
```
OPTION 1: DO NOTHING / ENTERPRISE-ONLY FOCUS
What it means: Continue current enterprise-only strategy
Requirements: Maintain current product, sales, marketing focus
Success looks like: Enterprise grows to $25M ARR; maintain >90% retention
Implications: Miss $2B market opportunity; competitors establish SMB dominance

OPTION 2: DUAL-SEGMENT STRATEGY (Recommended)
What it means: Create separate SMB offering while maintaining enterprise excellence
Requirements: New product team, separate GTM, $5M investment, 18-month timeline
Success looks like: Enterprise $25M + SMB $10M by Year 2
Implications: More complex organization, split resources, greater growth potential

OPTION 3: ACQUIRE SMB COMPETITOR
What it means: Purchase existing SMB solution; integrate into portfolio
Requirements: $50M acquisition, integration team, 12-month integration
Success looks like: Combined entity $30M by Year 2; cost synergies realized
Implications: High cash outlay, integration complexity, faster entry

COMBINATIONS:
- Option 2 + 3: Acquire to accelerate SMB entry while building separate product
  (Could work but most expensive)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Every possible option
- ❌ Detailed business plans for each

  - Do weights total to 100%?

- [ ] **Criteria are measurable or assessable**
  - Can we evaluate each option on each criterion?
  - Are criteria vague or specific?
  - Would different people score options similarly?
  - Can we defend scoring?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
STRATEGIC CRITERIA & WEIGHTS:

1. MARKET OPPORTUNITY (Weight: 30%) — How much growth potential?
   Definition: TAM size, growth rate, competitive window

2. FINANCIAL RETURNS (Weight: 25%) — Is ROI attractive?
   Definition: Investment required, revenue potential, profitability timeline

3. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING (Weight: 25%) — Improves competitive position?
   Definition: Defensible advantage, market leadership, moat strength

4. ORGANIZATIONAL FEASIBILITY (Weight: 20%) — Can we execute?
   Definition: Resource availability, capability gaps, execution risk

TOTAL WEIGHTS: 30% + 25% + 25% + 20% = 100% ✓

WEIGHTING RATIONALE:
- Market opportunity weighted highest because market entry window
  is time-limited; competitive dynamics changing fast
- Financial returns weighted highly because we're profitable
  company; can't justify massive investment
- Competitive positioning matters because we want defensible
  advantage, not temporary market share gain
- Organizational feasibility important but acknowledged: we can
  build capability; execution is more flexible than market timing
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect criteria
- ❌ Unanimous agreement on weights
- ❌ Quantified measurement
- ❌ Complex weighting schemes

```
DECISION MATRIX:

CRITERION                | Option 1    | Option 2    | Option 3
                        | (Do Nothing) | (Dual-Seg)  | (Acquire)
Market Opportunity      | 2/10        | 9/10        | 7/10
  (Weight: 30%)         | Limited to  | Captures    | Gains SMB
                        | enterprise  | $2B market  | access but
                        | growth      |             | limited upside

Financial Returns       | 8/10        | 8/10        | 6/10

                        | moves       | position    | challenges

Org Feasibility         | 9/10        | 6/10        | 5/10
  (Weight: 20%)         | No change;  | Dual focus; | High complexity;
                        | simple      | some risk   | major integration

WEIGHTED SCORES:
Option 1: (2×0.30) + (8×0.25) + (5×0.25) + (9×0.20) = 0.6 + 2.0 + 1.25 + 1.8 = 5.65/10
Option 2: (9×0.30) + (8×0.25) + (9×0.25) + (6×0.20) = 2.7 + 2.0 + 2.25 + 1.2 = 8.15/10 ← HIGHEST
Option 3: (7×0.30) + (6×0.25) + (7×0.25) + (5×0.20) = 2.1 + 1.5 + 1.75 + 1.0 = 6.35/10

- [ ] **Sensitivity analysis considered**
  - Would changing weights change outcome?
  - How sensitive is recommendation to key assumptions?
  - What would we need to be wrong about?
  - How confident are we in recommendation?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
KEY TRADE-OFFS:

Trade-off 1: Growth vs. Simplicity
- Option 2 wins on growth opportunity (9 vs. 2)
- Option 1 wins on organizational simplicity (9 vs. 6)
- Choice: Do we prioritize market opportunity or simplicity?
- Implication: If we choose Option 2, we accept complexity

Trade-off 2: Speed vs. Certainty
- Option 3 fastest to market (acquisition)
- Option 2 takes longer but more certainty (organic build)
- Choice: Do we value speed or control?
- Implication: If we choose Option 3, we accept integration risk

Trade-off 3: Capital vs. Upside
- Option 3 requires $50M; Option 2 requires $5M
- Option 3 faster returns; Option 2 longer payback
- Choice: How much capital can we deploy? How much risk?
- Implication: If we choose Option 3, large capital outlay

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:

"What if market opportunity is smaller than estimated?"
- If SMB market is $1B (vs. $2B), Option 2 score drops to 7.5/10
- Still wins vs. Option 1 (5.65) but closer to Option 3 (6.35)
- Conclusion: Even with downside, Option 2 wins

"What if we can't execute dual focus?"
- If organizational feasibility for Option 2 drops to 4/10
- Option 2 score drops to 7.25/10; still wins
- But risk is real; need strong governance

"What if competition moves faster?"
- If we lose first-mover advantage in SMB (Option 2 drops to 7/10)
- Option 2 still wins but margin tightens
- Timing is critical; can't wait
```

**What This Looks Like:**
```
RECOMMENDATION:
Option 2 - Dual-Segment Strategy is recommended.

RATIONALE:
Based on decision matrix, Option 2 scores 8.15/10 vs. 5.65 for Option 1
and 6.35 for Option 3. Primary reasons:
1. Captures substantial market opportunity (9/10 vs. 2/10 and 7/10)
2. Maintains financial attractiveness (8/10 across options)
3. Provides defensible competitive positioning (9/10)
4. While complex organizationally, risk is manageable with good governance

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH
- Market opportunity is well-researched and validated
- Financial case is solid across scenarios
- Organizational complexity is real but manageable
- Competitive timing is critical but window still open

WHAT WOULD CHANGE RECOMMENDATION:
- If we lose top SMB sales talent (makes Option 1 more attractive)
- If major enterprise customer signals concern about focus (Option 1)
- If we can't raise capital for investment (Option 1)
- If competitor moves extremely fast (might suggest Option 3 speed)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Executive decision on recommendation (this month)
2. If approved: Detailed execution planning for dual-segment strategy
3. Monthly governance review of progress
4. Gate review at 6 months to assess execution and adjust if needed
```

  - What triggers course correction?

- [ ] **Learning approach identified**
  - How will we test assumptions?
  - What would prove recommendation wrong?
  - How will we monitor and adjust?
  - What's decision point to reassess?

---

## Quality Checks (Before Approving)

Before confirming matrix is complete, ask yourself:

1. **Would decision-maker understand this?**
   - Can they see the options clearly?
   - Do they understand the criteria?
   - Can they see why recommendation emerges?
   - Would they have questions?

2. **Is recommendation defensible?**
   - Does it follow logically from matrix?
   - Would someone challenge the recommendation?
   - How would you respond to challenges?
   - Are trade-offs clear?

3. **Are all important factors considered?**
   - Are there criteria that should be included?
   - Are weighting realistic?
   - Would decision-makers agree with criteria?
   - Is anything missing?

4. **Could someone else score differently?**
   - Is scoring methodology clear?
   - Would scoring be similar?
   - Any subjective judgments?
   - How confident are we in scoring?

---

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Matrix is Ready When

All blocking criteria are met:
- Decision question is clear
- Strategic options are distinct and complete
- Decision criteria are relevant and weighted
- Options are evaluated against criteria
- Trade-offs are explicitly addressed
- Recommendation is clear and justified
- Documentation quality is good

**Matrix can guide strategic decision-making.**

---

### 🔄 Matrix Needs More Work When

- **Decision unclear?** → Clarify exactly what's being decided
- **Options not distinct?** → Define truly different strategic paths
- **Criteria weak?** → Ensure criteria align with what matters
- **Scoring inconsistent?** → Clarify methodology; apply consistently
- **Trade-offs invisible?** → Make explicit what we gain/lose
- **Recommendation unclear?** → Show clearly which option wins and why

---

## Common Issues & Resolution

| Issue | Signal | Resolution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Too many criteria** | "8 criteria to evaluate" | Consolidate to 4-6 key ones |
| **Criteria too vague** | "Can't score this" | Define specifically how to measure |
| **Scoring all similar** | "Everything scores 5-6" | Sharpen differentiation between options |
| **Matrix doesn't match recommendation** | "You said A but matrix shows B" | Fix scoring or rationale |
| **Weights seem arbitrary** | "Why is this 30%?" | Explain weighting rationale |
| **Missing obvious option** | "What about doing both?" | Add combination options |

---

## Post-Validation Actions

Once this checklist passes:

1. **Prepare for Decision**
   - Brief decision-maker on matrix
   - Prepare for likely questions
   - Confirm process and timeline
   - Identify any additional input needed

2. **Facilitate Decision**
   - Present matrix to executives
   - Walk through logic

# Strategic Discovery Readiness Checklist

## Purpose

Simple checklist for Strategic Orchestrator to assess readiness for strategic work handoff.

## Four Readiness Checks

### 1. Situation Clarity ✓

**Question:** "Do we understand the business context?"

- [ ] User can describe their business/organization
- [ ] User can explain their industry context  
- [ ] User can describe their current state/position
- [ ] Context is sufficient for persona selection

**NOT Required:**

- Complete business analysis
- Detailed competitive assessment
- Comprehensive organizational analysis

### 2. Challenge Definition ✓

**Question:** "Do we understand the problem or opportunity?"

- [ ] User can articulate what they're trying to address
- [ ] User can explain why this matters now
- [ ] User can describe the impact or importance
- [ ] Challenge is clear enough for strategic work to begin

**NOT Required:**

- Root cause analysis
- Quantified impact metrics
- Complete problem decomposition

### 3. Stakeholder Understanding ✓

**Question:** "Do we know who's involved and affected?"

- [ ] User knows who the key decision makers are
- [ ] User knows who would be involved in implementation
- [ ] User knows who would be affected by outcomes
- [ ] Stakeholder landscape is clear enough for strategic planning

**NOT Required:**

- Complete stakeholder mapping
- Detailed influence analysis
- Comprehensive change impact assessment

### 4. Outcome Expectations ✓

**Question:** "Do we understand what success looks like?"

- [ ] User has some vision of desired future state
- [ ] User can describe what they want to achieve
- [ ] User understands general success criteria
- [ ] Outcomes are clear enough to guide strategic work

**NOT Required:**

- Precise success metrics
- Detailed measurement frameworks
- Complete outcome specifications

## Overall Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready to Proceed When

All four dimensions have basic clarity:

- User can describe their context (doesn't need to be complete)
- User can explain their challenge (doesn't need to be quantified)  
- User knows key stakeholders (doesn't need full mapping)
- User has outcome vision (doesn't need precise metrics)

### 🔄 Continue Discovery When

Major gaps exist in understanding:

- User unclear about basic business context
- User can't explain why challenge matters
- User doesn't know who's involved
- User has no sense of desired outcomes

### 👤 User Signals Override Assessment

Always respect user readiness signals:

- **"I think we have enough to get started"** → Proceed
- **"Let me think about that more"** → Give space
- **"I'm ready to dive in"** → Proceed
- **"Can we explore this more?"** → Continue discovery

## Mode-Specific Thresholds

### Express Mode

- Accept initial answers to four dimensions
- Light follow-up only if major gaps
- Proceed when basic understanding exists

### Deep Discovery Mode

- Thorough exploration of each dimension
- Multiple follow-ups as valuable
- User controls transition timing

## Quality Check Questions

Before handoff, ask yourself:

1. **Can I recommend the right strategic persona?** (based on context understanding)
2. **Can I create a useful Strategic Context Brief?** (enough substance to guide specialist)
3. **Will the specialist have enough context to start productively?** (sufficient but not complete)
4. **Does the user feel ready to proceed?** (respect their signals)

## What This Checklist Does NOT Require

❌ **Deep analysis** - That's for the specialist personas  
❌ **Problem solving** - That's for the strategic work phase  
❌ **Complete information** - Just enough for productive start  
❌ **Perfect clarity** - User may still have uncertainties  
❌ **Detailed planning** - That comes in strategic methodology  

## What This Checklist DOES Ensure

✅ **Sufficient context** for smart persona selection  
✅ **Productive handoff** to specialist personas  
✅ **User readiness** for strategic work  
✅ **Efficient use of time** - not over-discovering or under-preparing

==================== END: strategic-discovery-checklist ====================

==================== START: strategic-narrative-validation-checklist ====================
# Strategic Narrative Validation Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that a completed Strategic Narrative document presents a compelling, evidence-based story arc that engages stakeholders and drives decision-making through narrative structure and persuasive communication.

## What Gets Validated

**Template Reference:** `templates/strategic-narrative.md`

**Used In:** STORY phase for narrative development

**Audience:** Executives, board, stakeholders reviewing strategic narrative

## Blocking Criteria (All Required)

### 1. Clear Story Arc ✓

- [ ] **Opening sets context and hooks attention**
  - Problem/opportunity presented compellingly
  - Why audience should care
  - Stakes are clear
  - Invitation to journey

- [ ] **Middle builds evidence and logic**
  - Analysis presented in digestible form
  - Findings build toward conclusion
  - Evidence woven throughout (not separated)
  - Logical progression from facts to implications

- [ ] **Closing shows implications and calls to action**
  - What findings mean for future
  - Decision or action required
  - Clear recommendation or options
  - Path forward articulated

**What This Looks Like:**
```
OPENING:
"Our enterprise business is thriving. We've built a category-leading
platform trusted by Fortune 500 companies. $15M ARR. 95% retention.
We're winning in the market we've chosen. But here's the problem:
in winning the enterprise market, we've missed a much larger opportunity
in the SMB market growing next door. A $2B market is growing at 25%
annually. Competitors are entering. Our window to claim significant
share is closing. This isn't a problem to fix. It's a strategic choice."

MIDDLE:
"Let me show you what's happening. Our SMB customers are churning at
15% annually—double our enterprise rate. Why? Primarily price.
We're a $10K-50K solution; SMB wants something at $1K-5K. It's not
that our product isn't good; it's that it's over-engineered for their
needs. Meanwhile, competitors are doing exactly what we're avoiding:
serving the SMB market with simplified, affordable solutions.

But here's where this gets interesting. While we were perfecting
enterprise, something changed in the market. SMB moved from 'me too'
market followers to primary market. And SMB customers increasingly
want what enterprise customers have: integrations, reliability,
predictability. But at SMB prices and simplicity.

We have something competitors don't: proven enterprise success.
Reference customers. Product quality. Retention rates that prove
value. If we could bring enterprise-grade reliability to SMB-friendly
simplicity and pricing, we'd have something unique."

CLOSING:
"So the choice is clear. We can continue our enterprise-only strategy.
It's proven. It's profitable. But it leaves $2B on the table and makes
us vulnerable if competitors move upmarket and drive enterprise pricing
pressure.

Or we can pursue a dual-segment strategy. Separate products. Separate
go-to-market. Separate teams. One focused on enterprise excellence.
One focused on SMB accessibility. It's more complex. It requires
discipline. But it doubles our addressable market and positions us
for market leadership.

The data supports the second path. The market supports it. And the
opportunity window says we need to decide—and begin executing—soon.

What I need from you: approval to pursue dual-segment strategy and
$5M investment to execute over 18 months. What you'll get: path to
$40M+ revenue by Year 3 and defensible market leadership position."
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Perfect storytelling
- ❌ Elaborate narrative devices
- ❌ Emotional manipulation
- ❌ Complete elimination of jargon

---

### 2. Evidence Woven into Narrative ✓

- [ ] **Findings are presented, not appended**
  - Data is integrated into story
  - Evidence supports claims
  - Numbers used when they matter
  - Sources transparent

- [ ] **Claims are supported by evidence**
  - "SMB customers churn at 15%" supported by data
  - "Competitors moving downmarket" with examples
  - "Market growing 25%" with source
  - No unsupported assertions

- [ ] **Confidence levels are clear**
  - What we're certain about vs. indicative
  - Where data is strong vs. exploratory
  - Caveats and limitations noted
  - Audience can assess credibility

**What This Looks Like:**
```
CLAIM: "SMB customers are churning at 15% annually"
EVIDENCE: "Our CRM data shows 40 of 250 SMB customers churned over
past 12 months. That's 16% actual rate. For comparison, enterprise
churn is 5%."
CONFIDENCE: "HIGH - this is our actual data"

CLAIM: "Price is the primary driver of SMB churn"
EVIDENCE: "We conducted exit interviews with 15 churned SMB customers.
Twelve cited price as primary reason. We also analyzed customer
success notes showing price concerns appear in 70% of at-risk accounts."
CONFIDENCE: "MODERATE - based on interviews and notes. Actual impact
could vary, but trend is clear."

CLAIM: "SMB market is $2B TAM growing at 25%"
EVIDENCE: "Third-party market research firm (Gartner, August 2024)
estimates $2B TAM. Multiple sources show 20-30% annual growth rates."
CONFIDENCE: "MODERATE - secondary research. Market moving fast.
Estimates vary $1.5B-3B depending on definition."
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Every claim cited
- ❌ Appendix of sources
- ❌ Academic-level documentation
- ❌ Perfect confidence assessment

---

### 3. Emotional Resonance Alongside Logic ✓

- [ ] **Story connects intellectually and emotionally**
  - Logic appeals to head
  - Stakes/implications appeal to heart
  - Audience cares about decision
  - Personal connection to outcome visible

- [ ] **Language is engaging and clear**
  - Not overly technical or academic
  - Active voice where possible
  - Concrete examples and specifics
  - Accessible to audience

- [ ] **Narrative momentum builds**
  - Opening creates curiosity
  - Middle sustains interest
  - Closing creates sense of urgency/opportunity
  - Audience wants to hear more

**What This Looks Like:**
```
EMOTIONAL APPEAL (not manipulation):

"Imagine you're a growing tech company with $2M in funding. You need
software to manage customer data and integrations. You find two options:

Option A: The enterprise solution. Feature-rich. Powerful. Reliable.
$50K annual contract. Requires implementation team. Learning curve.

Option B: The SMB solution. Simpler. Easier to use. $2K annual contract.
You're up and running in days.

You choose Option B. Not because it's inferior. But because it's
'good enough' for what you need. And the price and simplicity matter.

This is happening thousands of times in the SMB market right now.
And we're not winning those battles because we're Option A. We've
optimized for Option A. And while Option A is profitable, Option B
is where the market is moving."

LOGIC + EMOTION:
Intellectual: Market dynamics and opportunity size
Emotional: Recognition of missed customers, competitive threat, opportunity
Together: Sense that this is both right AND urgent
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Personal stories or anecdotes (not required)
- ❌ Dramatic language or hyperbole
- ❌ Theatrical presentation
- ❌ Perfect balance of head/heart

---

### 4. Clear Decision or Action Called For ✓

- [ ] **What's being asked is explicit**
  - What decision is needed?
  - What's the specific ask?
  - Timeline for decision
  - What happens next

- [ ] **Options are presented (if decision)**
  - What choices exist?
  - What would each mean?
  - What's recommended?
  - Why that recommendation?

- [ ] **Path forward is clear**
  - What happens if we decide yes?
  - What resources needed?
  - What's timeline?
  - What's success look like?

**What This Looks Like:**
```
THE ASK:
"I'm asking for two things:

1. Strategic approval to pursue a dual-segment strategy (enterprise +
SMB). This means separate products, separate teams, separate go-to-market.
Enterprise remains core focus and investment. SMB is additive opportunity.

2. Budget approval of $5M over 18 months to execute this strategy:
- $3M for product development (SMB product, simplified architecture)
- $1M for go-to-market (sales team, partnerships, marketing)
- $1M for operations (customer success, infrastructure)

WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES TO:
- Company becomes dual-segment operator (not venture scale-at-all-costs
  thinking, but profitable-growth mindset)
- R&D splits focus between enterprise evolution and SMB new product
- 18-month execution timeline to validate SMB viability
- Monthly reviews and milestone gates to ensure execution quality

WHAT YOU GET:
- Path to $40M+ revenue by Year 3 (vs. $25M enterprise-only)
- Market leadership position in both segments
- Defensible competitive moat (can't be beaten by pure price or pure
  feature plays)
- Optionality: if SMB works, we scale. If it struggles, we have proven
  enterprise business that remains strong.

TIMELINE:
- Decision: This month
- Execution start: Next month
- Phase 1 (Foundation): Months 1-6
- Phase 2 (Launch): Months 6-12
- Phase 3 (Scale): Months 12-18
- Review point: Month 18 (full assessment of viability)
```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Detailed implementation plan
- ❌ Complete business case
- ❌ Every possible scenario
- ❌ Risk mitigation for all risks

---

```

**What This Does NOT Require:**
- ❌ Separate narratives for each group (one good narrative works)

```
STRUCTURE:
1. Opening (Hook & Context) - ½ page
2. The Situation (What's happening?) - 1-2 pages
3. The Analysis (What did we learn?) - 2-3 pages
4. The Implications (What does it mean?) - 1 page
5. The Recommendation (What should we do?) - 1 page
6. The Path Forward (What happens next?) - ½ page

TOTAL: 6-8 pages (executive readable in 20-30 minutes)

TONE EXAMPLES:

Good: "SMB customers are churning at twice the rate of enterprise
customers, primarily because our pricing is misaligned with SMB budgets."
(Professional, clear, data-driven)

Not great: "Our SMB business is like a leaky bucket. Customers pour in,
but they're dripping out constantly." (Too metaphorical for executive
briefing)

Good: "We have an opportunity to capture $2B market while defending our
profitable enterprise position. The market window is likely 12-18 months
before competitive consolidation. Decision is strategic, not tactical."
(Clear stakes, urgency, significance)
