# Architecture Audit Plan
## File Access & Workflow Architecture Validation

**Date:** November 14, 2025
**Status:** Pre-Audit Planning
**Objective:** Identify gaps and misalignments between the proposed file-access-and-workflow-architecture.md and actual file structure

## Executive Summary

Before we can build an implementation checklist and refine the architecture document, we need to validate that:

1. **All referenced files actually exist** in the codebase
2. **All actual files are accounted for** in the architecture
3. **File relationships are correctly mapped** across phases
4. **Missing files are identified** for creation
5. **Naming consistency is verified** across directories

## Audit Approach

### Step 1: Inventory Current Files
- [ ] Count actual files in each directory
- [ ] Create master inventory of all existing files
- [ ] Note file modification dates (when were these created?)

### Step 2: Cross-Reference Architecture
- [ ] Map each file in Phase 0 (Discovery) against architecture
- [ ] Map each file in Phase 1-7 workflows against architecture
- [ ] Check persona-specific patterns for each of 6 personas
- [ ] Verify task-to-phase mappings (which tasks appear in which phases?)
- [ ] Verify template-to-phase mappings

### Step 3: Identify Gaps

#### Missing Files (Referenced but don't exist)
- Which tasks are referenced in the architecture but don't exist?
- Which templates are referenced in the architecture but don't exist?
- Which checklists are referenced in the architecture but don't exist?

#### Extra Files (Exist but not referenced)
- Which files exist but aren't mentioned in the architecture?
- Should these be integrated into the architecture?
- Are these legacy files to deprecate?

#### Naming Inconsistencies
- Do file names match what's referenced in the architecture?
- Are there naming convention violations?
- Should any files be renamed for consistency?

### Step 4: Create Audit Report
**Report will include:**
1. Inventory summary (what exists vs what's expected)
2. File-by-file validation matrix
3. Gap analysis (missing vs extra)
4. Naming consistency issues
5. Phase mapping validation
6. Persona workflow validation
7. Recommendations for alignment

### Step 5: Identify Quick Wins
- Which gaps are easiest to fix?
- Which misalignments are most critical?
- What's the natural sequence for fixing issues?

---

## Expected Findings

Based on initial review, we anticipate:

1. **Most files exist** - The project appears well-established with strong file coverage
2. **Checklists are substantially complete** - All phase completion checklists done; many quality/validation checklists recently created
3. **Some naming inconsistencies** - File names may not exactly match architecture references (e.g., "strategic-brief.md" vs "strategic-brief-tmpl.md")
4. **Possible missing tasks** - Some tasks referenced in architecture may not exist
5. **Possible extra files** - Some files may exist that aren't explicitly referenced in architecture

---

**Assessment:** Phase 7 is nearly complete but has one missing template. The execution-planning task exists and provides guidance for creating execution plans; the missing template appears to be an output structure that should formalize plan creation.

---

## Part 4: Issues & Findings

### Issue #1: Missing Execution Plan Template ⚠️ (MINOR)

**Severity:** Minor
**Impact:** Phase 7 completeness
**Status:** Resolvable

**Description:**
The architecture document references an "execution-plan" template in Phase 7, but this file does not exist in the templates directory.

**Context:**
- The `execution-planning.md` task file exists in the tasks directory and provides comprehensive guidance for creating execution plans
- Phase 7 includes a checklist for execution planning quality
- Other phases reference specific output templates (e.g., strategic-brief.md, financial-model.md)

**Recommendation:**
Create a new file: `/Users/greg/Projects/strategist-agent-v2/templates/execution-plan.md`

This template should:
1. Provide structure for translating the execution-planning task output into a formal execution plan
2. Include sections for timeline, accountability, resource allocation, dependencies
3. Support both high-level and detailed planning views
4. Reference the execution-planning-quality-checklist for validation

**Effort:** 2-3 hours (similar to other templates)

---

### Issue #2: Sector Module Stub Files ⚠️ (LOW PRIORITY)

**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Content completeness for manufacturing and healthcare sectors
**Status:** Consider for future enhancement

**Description:**
Two sector modules exist as placeholder/stub files with minimal content:
- `11_manufacturing-sector-module.md` (79 bytes)
- `12_healthcare-sector-module.md` (867 bytes)

**Context:**
- Technology module (30K), Mining/Services module (44K), and Crisis Management module (34K) are comprehensive
- Manufacturing and healthcare are important sectors that may benefit from full modules
- The `standardized-specialized-module-template.md` provides guidance for expanding these

**Recommendation:**
These are placeholder files that can be expanded if/when manufacturing or healthcare engagements require sector-specific patterns. Not urgent for architecture validation.

---

### Issue #3: Data File Naming Inconsistency ⚠️ (COSMETIC)

**Severity:** Cosmetic
**Impact:** Consistency of naming conventions
**Status:** Can be fixed immediately

**Description:**
File: `20_mining-services_economic-development-Module.md`

This file has inconsistent capitalization. The "M" in "Module" is capitalized, while all other sector modules use lowercase "module".

**Context:**
All other sector modules follow the pattern: `{number}_{description}-module.md` (lowercase)
- 10_technology-sector-module.md
- 11_manufacturing-sector-module.md
- 12_healthcare-sector-module.md
- 21_regional-economic-development-module.md
- 30_crisis-management-strategic-module.md

**Recommendation:**
Rename: `20_mining-services_economic-development-Module.md` → `20_mining-services_economic-development-module.md`

**Effort:** < 1 minute (simple rename)

## Checklist Design Principles

### 1. **Action-Oriented**
- Use active verbs: "Have we...", "Is the...", "Have you..."
- Each item should be testable and observable
- Avoid vague criteria

### 2. **Graduated Complexity**
- Basic tier: Foundational requirements
- Advanced tier: Depth and rigor requirements
- Expert tier: Excellence and innovation standards

### 3. **Linked & Referenced**
- Each checklist should reference the relevant task, template, or framework
- Create clear connections to strategic methodology phases
- Document what "done" means in context

### 4. **Honest About Minimums**
- What's truly required (blocking)
- What's nice to have (enhancing)
- What can be added later (deferrable)

### 5. **User-Centric**
- Written for both agents and humans
- Include rationale for each item
- Explain consequences of gaps

## Implementation Priority

### Priority 1 (MVP): Phase Completion Checklists
- Establish clear phase gates
- Enable confident persona handoffs
- Support quality assurance

### Priority 2: Template Validation Checklists
- Ensure populated documents are complete
- Support document quality
- Enable consistent outputs

### Priority 3: Task-Specific Checklists
- Ensure rigor in specific analyses
- Support work quality
- Enable continuous improvement

## Checklist Maintenance

### When to Update Checklists
1. After completing strategic engagements - validate checklist effectiveness
2. When adding new templates - create associated validation checklist
3. When refining tasks - update associated quality checklist
4. When processes change - update phase completion checklists

### Feedback Loop
- Track which checklist items are most frequently "not met"
- Identify patterns where checklists fail to catch issues
- Refine criteria based on real-world usage
- Share learnings across different strategic engagements

## Example Checklist Structure

```markdown
# [Phase/Template/Task] Checklist

## Purpose
Clear statement of what this checklist validates

## Why This Matters
Why these criteria are important to strategic success

## Checklist Items

### Section 1: [Category]

## Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready When
- All critical items checked
- No major gaps

### 🔄 Needs Work When
- Critical items unchecked
- Significant gaps identified

## Next Steps
What happens when this checklist is complete
```

## Success Metrics

A successful checklist system will:

1. **Reduce rework** - Catch issues before handing off
2. **Improve consistency** - Similar quality across engagements
3. **Accelerate handoffs** - Clear transition criteria
4. **Build confidence** - Structured validation reduces uncertainty
5. **Enable learning** - Track patterns and improve processes

## Questions for Refinement

1. Should checklists be mandatory blocking gates or advisory guidance?
2. What's the minimum viable checklist for each phase?
3. How do we balance thoroughness with efficiency?
4. Should checklists adapt based on engagement complexity level?
5. How frequently should checklists be revisited and refined?

# File Access & Workflow Architecture
## Strategic Orchestrator System Integration Guide

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the optimal architecture for accessing and sequencing files across the Strategic Orchestrator system. It provides:

1. **Clear file relationships** - How personas, tasks, templates, data, and checklists connect
2. **Workflow sequences** - Which files to load at each phase and why
3. **Access optimization** - Smart loading patterns to minimize context bloat
4. **Integration protocols** - How files inform and support agent actions

**Key Principle:** Files serve specific purposes at specific moments. The system should load what's needed when it's needed, not everything upfront.

---

## Part 1: File Ecosystem Overview

### File Categories & Purposes

#### 1. **Personas** (6 files) - Agent Behavior Definitions
- **Purpose:** Define how an agent thinks, decides, and communicates
- **When Loaded:** At persona initialization; stays loaded throughout engagement
- **Responsibility:** Orchestrator selects persona; persona is activated
- **Key Files:**

  - `strategic-analyst.md` - Data-driven analysis & insight
  - `strategic-specialist.md` - Problem decomposition & solutions
  - `strategic-communicator.md` - Narrative & synthesis
  - `strategic-advisor.md` - Decision & execution planning
  - `strategic-innovator.md` - Creative thinking & opportunities

#### 2. **Tasks** (28 files) - Executable Workflows
- **Purpose:** How-to instruction sets for specific strategic work
- **When Loaded:** When persona begins work on that task
- **Responsibility:** Persona selects appropriate task(s) for phase
- **Loading Pattern:** Lazy load - only when needed
- **Examples:**

- **Examples:**
  - `strategic-brief-tmpl.md` - Final executive summary format
  - `competitive-analysis.md` - Competitive analysis structure
  - `financial-model.md` - Financial projections structure
  - `risk-register.md` - Risk tracking format

#### 4. **Data** (11 files) - Knowledge Base
- **Purpose:** Strategic knowledge, frameworks, patterns, and industry context
- **When Loaded:** In layers based on context relevance
- **Responsibility:** Module integration logic determines activation
- **Loading Pattern:** Tiered activation - core always, specialized on demand
- **Structure:**
  - **Core Layer (00 prefix):** Always loaded
    - `00_strategic-kb.md` - Core methodology knowledge
    - `00_strategic-frameworks.md` - Universal strategic frameworks
    - `00_strategic-patterns.md` - Case studies and patterns

## Part 4: Smart File Loading Strategy

### The Problem We're Solving

Without a loading strategy, agents will:
- Load unnecessary files (context bloat)
- Miss important files (incomplete guidance)
- Load files at wrong times (confusion)
- Struggle with cross-phase coherence

### The Solution: Tiered Loading

#### Tier 1: Always-On Core
```
Load immediately and keep throughout engagement:
- Active persona (changes per phase)
- 00_strategic-kb.md (methodology reference)
- 00_strategic-frameworks.md (framework guidance)
- Strategic methodology handoff documents
```

#### Tier 2: Phase-Specific
```
Load at phase start, unload at phase end:
- Phase tasks (all relevant ones)
- Phase-specific data/frameworks
- Phase templates
- Phase checklists
```

#### Tier 3: On-Demand Specialty
```
Load only when needed:
- Sector-specific modules (if context matches)
- Specific task details (when executing task)
- Specific template details (when creating document)
- Specific checklist details (at transition points)
```

### Loading Logic Pseudocode

```
INITIALIZATION:
  Load active_persona
  Load 00_strategic-kb.md
  Load 00_strategic-frameworks.md
  IF sector_indicators_detected:
    Run module_integration_logic
    Load appropriate_sector_modules

PHASE_START:
  Load persona_for_phase
  Load all phase_tasks FOR_THIS_PHASE
  Load all phase_templates FOR_THIS_PHASE
  Load phase_completion_checklist
  Clear previous_phase_files (except outputs)

DURING_TASK:
  IF task_requires_specific_guidance:
    Load detailed_task_file
  IF creating_document:
    Load relevant_template
  IF validating_quality:
    Load relevant_quality_checklist

PHASE_TRANSITION:
  Run phase_completion_checklist
  IF checklist_passes:
    Create handoff_document (using persona_handoff_template)
    Unload current_phase_files
    Load next_phase_files
  ELSE:
    Identify gaps
    Continue work

PROJECT_COMPLETION:
  Load final_synthesis_template
  Create comprehensive_summary
  Create recommendations_document
  Archive all_working_documents
```
