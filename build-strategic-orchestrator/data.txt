## Decision Logic & Integration

### Module Activation Logic

```text
PRIMARY_ACTIVATION:
  IF context_indicators >= threshold
  AND strategic_complexity == high
  THEN activate_module(priority=high)

SECONDARY_ACTIVATION:
  IF related_context_present
  AND cross_domain_complexity == medium
  THEN activate_module(priority=medium, mode=supporting)

COMBINATION_RULES:
  WITH [related_module_1]: complement
  WITH [related_module_2]: sequence
  WITH [related_module_3]: conflict_resolution_required
```

### Progressive Specialization Strategy

1. **Initial Assessment**: `[how to determine if specialization is needed]`
2. **Specialization Trigger Points**: `[when to activate specialized frameworks]`
3. **Integration Checkpoints**: `[when to validate integration with core frameworks]`
4. **Quality Assurance**: `[specialized validation criteria]`

### Cross-Module Integration

- **Upstream Dependencies**: `[what inputs this module needs from other modules]`
- **Downstream Outputs**: `[what this module provides to other modules]`
- **Conflict Resolution**: `[how to handle conflicts with other specialized modules]`
