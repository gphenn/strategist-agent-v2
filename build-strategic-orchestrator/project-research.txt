==================== START: BaieVerte-REGISTERED-MUNICIPAL-PLAN-2022-2032 ====================
# Baie Verte Registered Municipal Plan (2022 - 2032)

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION 

### 1.1 The Purpose of the Municipal Plan 

The purpose of the Municipal Plan, 2022-2032 is to enable the community to pursue sustainable choicesI to meet the needs of the Town for the next 10 years. This updated Municipal Plan will replace the current Municipal Plan, 1984-1994 which was gazetted on November 1, 1985 {which replaced the previous 1977 plan). 

This updated plan provides an up to date, comprehensive policy framework to influence, manage, and regulate future growth and change in the Town of Baie Verte. 

###1.2 Authority

The Municipal Plan and Development Regulations are legal documents created under the authority of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000. They apply throughout the Municipal Planning Area which is established under the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000; note that the Municipal Planning Area boundary is the same as the Municipal Area boundary under the Municipalities Act, 1999.
 
The policies and development requirements contained in the documents and mapping are binding uponI the Town Council, residents and on any person undertaking a development within the Municipal Planning Area boundary {Section 12 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000). 

The Municipal Plan guides the future growth and physical improvement of the Town by identifying locations and setting out policies for various types of land use development. These locations are shown as land use designations on the Future Land Use map found in the appendices. 

The Municipal Plan authorizes Council to prevent the undertaking of any development that contravenes a policy stated in the Municipal Plan. 

The Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000 requires the preparation of Development Regulations to ensure that land is controlled and used in compliance with the Plan {Section 35); these form a separate companion document to the plan. The Development Regulations enable the Council to administer the policies of the Municipal Plan. The Municipal Plan provides the basis for the Development Regulations which provide more refined zoning within the land use designations indicating permitted and discretionary uses in each zone, development standards and conditions, and criteria for the evaluation of subdivision and development applications. The land use designation and zones apply on both public and private land. 

The Municipal Plan 2022-2032 that comes into legal effect upon publication of the notice of registration 
in the Newfoundland and Labrador Gazette, and at that point the Municipal Plan, 1984-1994, is repealed 
and replaced by the new Municipal Plan, 2022-2032. 

### 1.3 The Municipal Planning Process

The process for preparing a plan is set out in Part 111of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000 (Sections 14 -25) and it can only be undertaken by a certified planner in good standing with the Canadian Institute of Planners.

A Background Report was prepared to inform the Municipal Plan review. It provides the key findings of statistical research, community site visits and discussions with the Town staff and Council, a questionnaire to elicit resident preferences and concerns, information gleaned from Provincial agencies and community representatives, including public consultation.

The Background Report contains a review of land use, development and infrastructure servicing issues, and a socio-economic profile of the Town of Baie Verte. As well, an analysis was undertaken of the 1984 planning documents and mapping. The Background Report provides the foundation for preparation of the plan update. It can be found in the appendices.

As part of the planning process, the Local Governance and Land Use Planning Division circulates the proposed planning documents and mapping to other government agencies through the Interdepartmental Land Use Committee (ILUC). These specific requirements are also integrated into the planning documents. As this ILUC report is an internal government document, it cannot be reproduced in the Municipal Plan.

An important part of this process is the public consultation requirements which ensure that residents and stakeholders have adequate access to information regarding land use and development regulation proposals including an adequate opportunity to respond to these proposals. There are a minimum of three key opportunities for public participation:
 
#### at the outset of the plan review project to solicit ideas and concerns of residents, stakeholders, business owners, Council and Town staff (Community survey-195 responses; Public Consultation session on September 16, 2020; Meetings with Council, staff and community representatives; 

#### when the draft proposed planning documents and maps are ready for provincial review under Section 15 (Public consultation session with presentation-June 15, 2021); and, 

#### the Public Hearing, where an independent Commissioner can hear objections or submissions regarding the planning documents and maps released from the Section 15 review and adopted by Council. 

The Municipal Plan must address the future land use and development of the Municipal Planning Area for a 10-year period. The Municipal Plan must be reviewed every five years (Section 28}, and reviewed comprehensively again at 10 years' time as the scope of the plan is required to anticipate the needs of the Town of Baie Verte for a 10-year period.

Amendments can be made to the Municipal Plan and Development Regulations at any time. Amendments must follow the procedure (Sections 14-25} set out in the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000 (Section 25).

Note that a Resolution of Council alone cannot amend (or circumvent) a requirement contained in the Municipal Plan or Development Regulations. 

### 1.4 Organization of the Plan

The Municipal Plan is organized into five chapters: 
**Chapter 1** sets the legal context of the planning process; 
**Chapter 2** sets out the Objectives for of the Town of Baie Verte that apply generally throughout the community to achieve sustainability;

## 4.2 Provincial and Federal Interests
 
In preparation for the Municipal Plan Review, the Local Governance and Planning Division referred the Town of Baie Verte review notice to the Interdepartmental Land Use Committee (ILUC). ILUC consists of about 16 government departments and agencies with land use and development jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding the general compliance policy regarding all federal and provincial statutes, regulations, policies and guidelines, it is the policy of Council to: 
1) Climate Change: Take into consideration available data regarding provincial climate change projections for the nearest regional sites when considering land for future developments that are in close proximity to a river, floodplain or coastline. These projections suggest that extreme precipitation events will become more intense, by about 25%. Climate change is expected to result in more precipitation and more frequent extreme weather events that may result in increased flooding, sea surge and coastal erosion. These factors should be considered when allocating land for future developments that are in close proximity to a river, floodplain or coastline; 
2) Archaeology: Any public works project or major land development that results in ground disturbance must be sent to Provincial Archaeology Office (PAO) for review. As well, any accidental discoveries of historic resources should also be reported to the PAO. Before approval is granted for a major development such as a subdivision or a new commercial or public building, the application shall be referred to the Provincial Archaeology Office for comments. 
3) GIS & Mapping: Inform the GIS & Mapping Division when a proposed development is proposed in the vicinity of a Survey Control Monument. There are 18 survey monuments in the Municipal Planning Area. The locations of the survey control markers can be viewed at: https://arcg.is/lrWnSC and they are set out on the Future Land Use and Land Use zoning maps . Any development applications occurring in the vicinity of these markers must be referred to the GIS & Mapping Division; 
4) Agriculture: Consult with the Land Resource Stewardship Division regarding commercial agricultural development applications; Set out the Agricultural Development Area (ADA) on the Future Land Use and Land Use zoning maps and require that all applications within the ADA be referred to the Land Resources Stewardship Division for comment. 
5) Mineral Resource Lands: 
a. 300 Quarry buffer: Map this referral buffer as an overlay on the Future Land Use map and the Land Use Zoning map and require all proposed development applications within the 300 metre buffer to be referred to the Mineral Lands Division for approval; 
b. Indicate that mineral exploration that is not a development is allowed as a permitted use in all zones and that mineral exploration that is a development is indicated as a discretionary use; and development requirements regarding potential mining should be incorporated into the regulations;

c. Where fish habitat is affected, requiring appropriate approvals from Fisheries and Oceans Canada; 
d. Maintaining, where possible, existing vegetation along banks and shorelines for protection of riparian habitat; 
8) Forestry 
a. Forestry activities are: 
i. a permitted use in the Rural zone, including domestic harvesting; 
ii. a discretionary use in the Environmental Protection and, 
iii. subject to the policy in 7 (a) (iv) as a discretionary use in the Protected Water Supply zone. 
9) NL Hydro 
a. Provide a definition of easements for public utilities will be set out in the Development Regulations and: 
i. no development, including quarrying, will be allowed in these easements; and, 
ii. Access by service providers will be protected. 
b. As part of the application review process, refer new development applications to NL Hydro and approval must be received prior to construction commencing; 
10) Wildlife 
a. Consider the services of staff involved with in the Wildlife Division who work with the Eastern Habitat Joint Venture to discuss the incorporation of wildlife and conservation values in municipal plans and associated development regulations. 
b. Address general wildlife habitat and landscape connectivity during application review, with the following standards: 
i. a riparian buffer of 30 m minimum undisturbed natural vegetated along wetlands and waterbodies (ponds, rivers, creeks etc.). or more for riparian areas near agricultural areas. 
ii. green belts connected to forested areas or other habitat patches to create wildlife travel corridors; 
iii. incorporate a minimum percentage of forests to be maintained during lot clearing, for example. Vegetation clearing should always be done outside the May 01 to July 31 period (note that some raptors start breeding in March) to minimize disturbance during that sensitive breeding/ young rearing; 
11) Environmental Assessment Division 
a. Protect Baie Verte River, as a scheduled salmon river, by requiring development applications within 200 metres of the high water mark of a scheduled salmon river be registered with the Environmental Assessment Division, as required by Section 28 of the Environmental Protection Regulations, 2002.

In order for the Town of Baie Verte to achieve the Vision, Objectives and Policies articulated in their Municipal Plan, the Council will need to: 
� Adopt Development Regulations as a tool for administration and implementation; 
� Issue development permits for new development, change of use, or to subdivide land, in accordance with the Development Regulations; 
� Implement a Capital Works program consistent with the Municipal Plan policies; 
� Ensure a clear and efficient approach to the development review, decision-making, and appeal processes; and, 
� Undertake to conduct research to inform decision-making in Plan implementation. 

Development Regulations are one of the main vehicles through which Plans are implemented. The Town will review, revise and adopt Development Regulations pursuant to Section 35 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000. 

## 5.2 Amendments to the Plan 

Council may consider amendments to the Municipal Plan when: 
1. There have been significant changes to the community since the preparation of the Background Report that provided the factual basis for the policies in this Municipal Plan; 
2. Studies have been undertaken by the Town or the Provincial or Federal governments which contain recommendations or policies which should be incorporated into the Municipal Plan; 
3. A development proposal is submitted to Council which provides sufficient information and rationale to support a change in the Municipal Plan;

In considering any proposed amendment to the Plan, the Council should evaluate the proposal for consistency with the strategy for growth of the Town, as established in the goals, objectives and policies of the Municipal Plan. An associated amendment may be required to the Development Regulations. As per Section 25 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000, an amendment to the Municipal Plan (and an amendment to the Municipal Plan and Development Regulations) must follow the process set out in Sections 14 -25 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000. Council is not bound to make an amendment and this decision is not appealable under Part VI of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000.

A person may request to have the zoning of a parcel of land changed in order to accommodate a use or development not permitted under its' current zoning. This might only require an amendment to the Development Regulations without amendment to the Municipal Plan. Alternatively, a Development Regulations amendment may consist of a change to the text of the regulations. In considering requests for Development Regulation amendments, Council shall consider: 
� all appropriate policies set out in this Plan; 
� the provision of road, water and sanitary and storm sewer services and the impact on existing infrastructure; 
� the fiscal impact of the development on the Town; 
� community/neighbourhood context for the proposed development; 
� environmental considerations, emissions, effluents, nuisance effects; and, 
� site suitability: slope, groundwater, location of watercourses and wetlands. 

The procedure for an amendment to the Development Regulations only is set out in the Development Regulations. 

## 5.3 Review of the Plan

The Council for the Town of Baie Ve rte will undertake a review of the Municipal Plan every five years in accordance with the requirements of Section 28 of the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000. This review may be comprehensive or it may consist of an audit of progress that confirms that the Plan is still relevant. The review process is valuable to the Council and residents to ensure that the administration of the community achieves the objectives of its residents.

## 1.0 Introduction 

## 1.1

**Town of Baie Verte Municipal Planning Area**

The Town of Baie Verte, with a population of approximately 1,315, is located on the Baie Verte 
Peninsula in the Central North Coast Area of the province, approximately 45 km from the Trans.Canada Highway #1. Baie Verte is approximately 160 km from the Town of Deer Lake where I there is a regional airport, 270 km from the Town of Gander where there is an international airport. The town is 425 km to Port aux Basque for the ferry service to the mainland. There is also a port nearby, Point Rousse facility, which services the mining operations. The Town was incorporated as a town in 1958. The Baie Verte Municipal Planning area borders the major mining operation at the Pine Cove open pit mine, Mill and tailings facility, the Stog'er Tight and Argyle deposits (and approximately 5,800 hectares of prospective gold-bearing property) which are operated by Anaconda Mining, a TSX-listed gold mining company. The town serves as a regional service centre for towns on the northern tip of the Baie Verte peninsula. 

The Baie Verte Municipal Planning Area established under the Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000 and providing land use planning authority is the same as the Town's Municipal Area Town established under the Municipalities Act, 1990 which provides taxation authority amongst many other municipal powers. 

The current Municipal Plan and Development Regulations, 1984-1994 was prepared by the Land Use Planning Division of the Department of Municipal and Provincial Affairs. Needless to say, after 36 years, the Town is in need of an updated plan and regulations to help Council meet the needs of the community. 

**History and Geography**
Baie Verte's history goes back to the days of the 'French Shore' when French fishermen went there to cut wood. The French named the area for its greenness, "green bay." Although the French controlled the area until 1904, English families were fishing and farming there as early as the 1879's. 

A copper and sulphur mine, Terra Nova Mine, opened near Baie Verte in the 1850s, and mining and lumbering were the main occupations of the community until the mine closed in about 1915. By the turn of the century fishing had been generally abandoned by the residents as the effort involved in getting to the fishing grounds was too great. Around 1938, the forestry company, Bowater Pulp and Paper Company, commenced harvesting in the area and forestry became the economic mainstay and 1961 there were over 900 residents in the Town Mining again became important in 1963 when Advocate Mines Ltd began asbestos operations, and shortly afterwards Consolidated Rambler began mining copper again. By the late 1970s half the labour force was employed in mining, and the town populations was over 2500 in 1976. The mine closed in 1982 (but was open sporadically between 1995-98. Consolidated Rambler then briefly ran the Nugget Pond gold mine from 1997-2001. 

In the late 2000s, Anaconda opened the Pine Cove gold mine (2008) and reopened the former Nugget Pond mine to process gold-bearing ore from Greenland (2007). Forestry industries continued to offer some employment. 

Meanwhile, the Town of Baie Verte remained the main service centre on the peninsula. It also became the home to a campus of College of the North Atlantic. Tourism increased in importance as part of the Dorset Trail and the Miners' Museum (which features a mining tunnel). Other attractions in the area include the Dorset Soapstone Quarry at Fleur de Lys, 29 km north of Baie Verte and hiking trails with beaches and lighthouses in the region. 

## 2.0 Demographics and Economy 

##2.1 The People 

In 2016, the population of Baie Verte was 1,315, about a 50% decrease since the first municipal plan was prepared in the mid-1980's when the 1981 population was 2,692. However, lifestyles and expectations regarding community services and amenities have changed dramatically in the past 36 years. 

The changes to the Municipal Plan need to reflect the changes in the demographic profile of the community. To look at this more closely, the population of the town was examined by age groups over the past 20 years, as shown on the figure below. By this time, the change in 
population from 1996 of 1,620 residents to 1,315 residents in 2016 represents a decrease of 24%. It should be noted that the decrease between 1996-2006 was greater, but that the overall population actually grew from 1,275 in 2006 to the 1,315 in 2016. The question is whether this constitutes a trend for the future? Which age groups are growing and what services do they 
need? Are the amenities of 2006 sufficient or suitable to deal with the needs of 2016? 

```Chart
Population change by Age groups, 1996-2016
```

First of all, in these 30 years, the greatest drop in the number of residents occurred between 1996 and 2006, and secondly, the population actually increased between 2006 to 2016. This pattern is strongly evident for the 25-44-year-olds who represent the prime younger work force, and in the 0-4 and5-14-year-olds who would be their children. 

Consistent with the overall aging population of the province as a whole, the Town of Baie Ve rte is also experiencing growth for all age groups over 55 years of age since 2016. What was interesting between 2006 and 2016 was that children aged 0-4 and 5-14 increased slightly, while teenagers (15-19) decreased dramatically while 20-24-year-olds (post-secondary) remained stable. 

This would indicate that the Town needs to assess whether the community amenities for children continue to meet their needs and whether there are more amenities needed by seniors that can be provided by the Town. For more detailed household analysis, only the past 10-year period was used wherever Statistics Canada categories were clearly the same (data collection definitions change from one census to the next). 

The 2016 Census indicates that the average household size is 2.3 persons, down from 2.7 in 2006 even though the population increased during this time. This is reflected in the Table below regarding number of people in households.

In 2016, 22% of the households are only 1-person households (as compared to 16% in 2006) and 45% are 2-person households. 

| Private households by household size  | 2006  | 2011  | 2016 |
|--|--|--|--|
| Total  | 480 | 535 | 545 |
| 1 person | 75 | 90 | 120 |
| 2 persons | 245 | 245 |
| 3 persons | 100 | 90 |
| 4 persons | 85 | 70 |
| 5 or more persons | 20 | 15 |

In order to understand the housing demand in the Town of Baie Ve rte, it is helpful to understand the household composition and associated housing needs. The 2016 Census provides information about the household types using census family information. A census family is defined as a married couple and the children, if any, of either and/or both spouses; a couple living common law and the children, if any, of either and/or both partners; or a lone parent of any marital status with at least one child living in the same dwelling and that child or those children. 

| Private households by household type | 2011 | 2016 |
|--|--|--|
| - One-census-family households | 435 | 415 | 
| -- Without children in a census family | 200 | 215 | 
| -- With children in a census family | 165 | 200 |
| - Multiple-census-family households | 20 | 0 | 
| - Non-census-family households | 105 | 125 |
| -- One-person households | 90 | 120 | 
| -- Two-or-more person non-census-family households | 10 | 10 |
| | Total private households | 540 |

� 23% of the households are not census families; 
� 77% are one-census family households and of these, 52% of the one-census families do not have children; 

From these statistics, it would appear that the Town of Baie Verte is a family-oriented community. The growing number of single person households could be attributed to the growing aging population rather than the 20-24-year-old age group which has remained stable during the same time period. Therefore, family-oriented services and amenities would need to be provided as well as services suitable for single seniors. 

The educational level in the community has improved as the percentage of individuals with higher education has doubled (see the Table below) and the percentage with no high school certificate, college diploma and university degree dropped from 36% to 14% of the total population. The level and type of education reflects the type of employment opportunities offered in the community. 

| Education Level | 2006 | 2016 |
|--|--|--|
|          Total population | 1060 | 695 |
| No certificate; diploma or degree | 385 | 95 |
| High school certificate or equivalent | 155 | 135 |
| Apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma | 215 | 110 |
| College; CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma | 185 | 235 |
| University certificate or diploma below the bachelor level | 25 | 10 |
| University certificate; diploma or degree | 100 | 110 |


## 2.2 The Economy, Labour and Income 
The Town's economy is dominated by the Rambler and Anaconda mining operations. Anaconda Mining Inc. constructed and is operating a marine dock and loading facility adjacent to its existing Pine Cove Gold Mine. The Point Rousse Port Facility is located on the Point Rousse Peninsula, along the northern portion of the Baie Verte Peninsula, approximately three kilometres northeast of Baie Ve rte. The project includes a new access road, a crusher and crushed rock stockpile laydown area, a conveyor loading system, shoreline and cribbed mooring bollards, rockfill approaches, and a temporary barge. 

The Town acts as a regional service centre for the top of the Baie Verte Peninsula. There are at least 10 communities on roads that must pass through the Town of Baie Verte with a 2016 population of 2,797 people who would likely seek services in the Town of Bay Verte before travelling the additional hour to Springdale or beyond. While both the population of Baie Verte and the outlying communities are declining, it should be noted that the Town of Baie Verte actually increased in population between 2006-2016. One question is whether there are seniors from the catchment area who are retiring into old age homes in Baie Verte? Are younger families from the region moving into Baie Verte for more programs and facilities for their children? Or are the two trends completely unrelated?

The following figure and table were developed by the Community Accounts, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador using Census Canada, 2016 statistics; it indicates a clear distinction 
in the types of employment and gender participation.

Census Canada provides a way to compare the income levels within a community by organizing income into ten equal categories or deciles. In Baie Verte, 50% of the population are in the bottom deciles {which helps to explain why 19% of households spend more than 30% of income on shelter) and 50% are in the top deciles. This is similar to the rest of the province.

From the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, Community Accounts website, the 
following information was excerpted. 
 
The 2017 self-reliance ratio for Baie Verte was 
78.9%. This is a measure of the community's dependency on government transfers such as: Canada Pension, Old Age Security, Employment Insurance, Income Support Assistance, etc. A higher self-reliance ratio indicates a lower dependency. The self-reliance ratio in the province was 79.9%

## 2.3 Housing

Not surprisingly, the dominant housing form is the single detached home, as shown on the table below.

**Occupied private dwellings by structure type of dwelling,2016** 

| | 2006 | 2016  |
|--|--|--|
| Total | 480 | 545  |

* apartments/duplex 

Most of the dwellings are over 36 years old (62%) and 8% are 26 -35 years old and 12% are 16-26 years old. The census data indicated that most housing (93%) only required regular maintenance and that all was considered suitable housing by the occupants. 

**Occupied dwellings by period of construction, 2016**

With regard to seniors housing, currently there are There are 2 seniors housing complexes: 
1. White Bay Retirement Living Complex (opened in 2019) 
2. Riverside Cottages (opened in 2017) 

## 3.0 Existing Land Use 
The original Town core was located west of Rattling Brook, behind the harbour front. As the need for more residential land grew, the area at the head of the bay was developed, called 'Newtown'. Ribbon development naturally happened along Route 410. 

The total size of the community is 390 km2; of this, about 2.5 km2 consists of the urban core (see map below). For this reason, the previous plan prepared in 1989 cautioned that, due to a lack of developable land, great care must be taken with all remaining usable land.

## 3.1

**Residential Land Use**

In the 1960's, Advocate Mines recognized the corporate advantages of creating a "nice" Town for their employees and thus was instrumental in providing both housing and recreation facilities. This involvement of the largest employer in the Town, coupled with the semi.insolation location, promoted the feeling of 'Community' and led to pride in the Town at that time. Residents had community amenities that were provided by the company and not by municipal government. This is no longer the case. 

The old Town is primarily Residential Medium Density (RMD) which takes in existing residential development and areas of infill opportunity. There are not many empty lots; however, some of these were turned into unorganized parking lots by the landowners. Also, infill development would not meet current RMD standards. The old town is surrounded by steep terrain that is not suitable for extending the RMD zone. 

There is a large area of land identified for RMD in the Newtown area, shown in the map below. However, there has been no development in the area to date and any future development should require a comprehensive plan to be submitted to ensure proper layout of roads 
and services. This area would be better to be identified as a Comprehensive Development Area.
Residential. Note that at the end of the road the Town will be developing a municipal facility.
 
The 'New Town' area has a Residential Low Density (RLD) area and homes have already been built into the adjacent Comprehensive Development Area. On Southshore Drive there is an established mobile home zone that is well-taken care of; however, there is limited opportunity 

The Comprehensive Development Area in 'New Town' neighbourhood. 
Note that residential development is also permitted in the Mixed Zone.

There are 2 Senior Citizens accommodation facilities: White Bay Retirement Living which is located in a Commercial General zone along the Provincial Highway Route 410 and Riverside Cottages for seniors which is also located in a Commercial General Zone (towards the college).

## 3.2 Employment-Generating Land Uses 

### 3.2.1 Commercial Land Use 

Currently there are two general locations identified for the 'Commercial General' zone, both sides of Route 410 and two sites within the 'New Town' neighbourhood. Both are not fully utilized. 

The other commercial zone is 'Downtown Commercial' located on a local road off Route 410 in the 'old town' neighbourhood (shown in red on the map below). A town park with a Memorial monument is at the heart of the area. This is landscaped with benches and a small walkway. In the winter, the Christmas parade also convenes at this location. During both Remembrance Day and Christmas events, residents either walk to the site or park in a communal parking area or in front of homes. The Town has not received any complaints regarding parking. 

One of the main commercial buildings is actually located by the waterfront in the 'Industrial and Marine Fishing' zone (shown in pink in the map below). The area is mostly built up but has potential vacant lands for future development as well as potential for streetscape beautification. Unfortunately, the best waterfront property is owned by Irving Oil. This land is under remediation. Until the remediation is completed, the site cannot be developed or used by the community as a public gathering space. 

### 3.2.2 Mixed Land Use

The 'Mixed Development' zone is located on a local road leading into the 'Downtown Commercial' zone and essentially represents an extension of that zone, but allows single dwelling residential use as well. The types of uses need to be reviewed, in particular, the 
residential density uses.

As well, this zone could be used in other locations within the community to allow for better use I of viewscapes or other geographic features. 

### 3.2.3 Tourism-oriented Land Use

The Town has only one tourism-related attraction, the Miner's Museum. There is a trail along the Conservation zone on the east side of Route 410 between the recreation facilities and the Rattling Brook park parking lot. There is a hike to a waterfall from this parking lot with views over the community and across the bay. 

Other initiatives include: 
� Bay Verte Marina Project (no Harbour Authority 
� Waterfront Beautification project (harbourfront) 
� Spruce Trail Cross-country Trails

### 3.2.4 Industrial Land Use 

Within the urban area of the Town, there is a Light Industrial zone applied to two locations which currently do not contain light 
industrial uses. Unlike many of the smaller surrounding communities, Baie Verte is not a fishery-based community. The Town has an 
active fish plant (owned by the Quinlan Brothers) and a Town marina (both located on Water Street). There are private wharves and stages scattered around the community.

The other industrial-type zone is 'Mineral Workings' which is applied to the former asbestos mine site and the Rambler site. 

## 3.3 Public/Institutional Land Use
 
The Town of Baie Verte has infrastructure and activities required for most every recreational activity, whether inside or out, winter or summer.

The map below shows the current 'Community and Social Services' (CSS) zoning for review. Some of the former public buildings will be re-purposed and zoning will be changed to facilitate these initiatives, for example, the empty school on High Street is proposed for the location of the new Community Centre; therefore, the public use and parking area requires appropriate zoning.

Other CSS locations identified in the past plan will be reviewed for future validity. As well, the uses permitted in the zone will be clarified. In some cases, it is not necessary to 'spot' zone for specific uses. For example, to accommodate a trend across the province, in other municipal plans, a church could be made a discretionary use in RMD and CG zones which would allow the denominations to re-purpose the building in the future without the cost of rezoning the property should this be necessary. 

## 3.4 Environmental Protection Land Uses 
The major environmental issue concerning the Town of Baie Verte is the protection of Southern Pond as a water supply source for future use. 

Currently it is in a 'Conservation' zone; however, it is proposed I that the designated area by zoned 'Watershed Protection' and that the land uses are subject to the Water Resource Management Division policies. 

Now that the water supply area is protected under the Water Resources Act, 1990, there remains the question regarding whether the previous 'Environmental Protection' zone is required for such a large area of the Town. 

Other 'Environmental Protection' designations occur along water bodies, the Baie Verte River and South River. 

Consideration should be given to defining this zone for protection of geophysical resources and habitat, as well as areas with geological hazards (steep slopes) or susceptible to climate change effects (flooding). 

The Open Space-Park-Recreation zone is applied throughout the community in a variety of ways. These locations need to be reviewed for current relevance and the use of this zone might be re-purposed to protect areas where natural areas need protection for recreational use focused on nature appreciation, such as trails, picnic areas, and viewscapes.

## 3.5 Rural Land Use 

The Rural zone encompasses the largest area of the Town and accommodates a range of natural resource uses, such as forestry and agriculture. The zone is also used for discretionary uses that are not compatible with the uses in the urban core. These will be reviewed to ensure that definitions are clear and as much as possible, the range of uses are appropriate for Baie Ve rte 
hinterland.

## 3.6 Provincial Land Uses and Regulations

The updated Municipal Plan and Development Regulations must reflect the land use designations and regulations of various provincial government agencies. At the time of the preparation of the Background Report, the comments from the Interdepartmental Land Use Committee had not been completed; however, the Land Use Atlas maintained by that department had been used to prepare the draft mapping showing updated locations for provincial concerns. 

##4.0 Public Services
 
## 4.1 Services

The Town is responsible for municipal services including 
� Fire Department 
� Water & Sewer 
� Garbage Collection 
� Snow Clearing 
� Library (Town provides space for free) 
� road maintenance 
� street lighting 

The provincial highway, Route 410 is the main road through the community and those 64 km are maintained by the provincial government. As provincial highways, a highway access permit is required. 

The modern growth era of Baie Verte began with the establishment of the asbestos mine (Advocate Mines) by Johns-Manville, in the early 1960's. Much of the Town's infrastructure, such as roads, and water and sewer systems, was constructed at that time. All buildings are fully serviced with water and sewer.

The local road network is maintained by Council, which consists of about 18 km of paved streets. Most local roads have pavement but hardly any sidewalks, some curbs and occasional ditches for drainage. The condition of the roads overall is poor. All roads have visible signage for public safety. The town is responsible for snow clearing. 

The volunteer fire Dept is very active and efforts to regionalize fire services with some neighbouring communities are currently underway.
 
## 4.2 Governance

Council is comprised of six Councilors and a Mayor. The Council holds regular monthly meetings and if situations dictate, more frequently. As well, Council can and may continue to hold special meetings and privileged meetings as situations may demand.

The Council operates within a set of Rules of Procedure to demonstrate order, sensibility and accountability at all meetings. Accountability for decisions is demonstrated in the Minutes of Meetings where all decisions of Council are documented using standard parliamentary procedures. 

The Councils' budget is prepared in accordance with the policy of the Provincial Government's Department of Municipal and Provincial Affairs. The preparatory work is completed by a Finance Committee and presented to Council, ratified by Council and submitted to the Department of Municipal and Provincial Affairs within the time lines established by the Municipalities Act, 1990. The budget normally receives tentative approval, final approval depending on receipt of the financial statements and audit reports for that previous budget year. 

The Council has the following Committees: 
� Recreation and Community Services 
� Finance and Policy 
� Planning and Development 
� Public Works 

The Town has a balanced budget of over $2M (2019) and a debt ratio of 6%.

Town staff include a Chief Administrative Officer, Financial Officer/Town Clerk, Superintendent 
of Public Works, a Financial Clerk and an Administrative Assistant plus outside municipal 
workers.

33,Low-income status - The income situation of the statistical unit in relation to a specific low-income line in a reference year. Statistical units with income that is below the low-income line are considered to be in low income.

For the 2021 Census  the reference period for income data is the calendar year 2020  unless otherwise specified.

Prior to the 2021 Census  the LIM thresholds and the LIM low income statistics were derived and reported for the population residing outside of the territories and off reserve only. It was based on the consideration that the income  prices and expenditure patterns could be quite different in the territories and on reserve  and thus  could make the interpretation of the LIM low-income statistics difficult.

Since the 2016 Census  there were research studies that analyzed the feasibility of defining LIM thresholds that include the population living in the territories and on reserve  and examined the aspects that should be considered when interpreting low-income statistics based on this definition.  With the guidance and support of such research  the 2021 Census expanded the coverage of the LIM concept to all regions in Canada  making it the only low-income concept that is applicable to the population living in the territories and on reserve.

Low-income measure  after tax (LIM-AT) - The Low-income measure  after tax  refers to a fixed percentage (50%) of median-adjusted after-tax income of private households. The household after-tax income is adjusted by an equivalence scale to take economies of scale into account. This adjustment for different household sizes reflects the fact that a household's needs increase  but at a decreasing rate  as the number of members increases.

Using data from the 2021 Census of Population  the line applicable to a household is defined as half the Canadian median of the adjusted household after-tax income multiplied by the square root of household size. The median is determined based on all persons in private households where low-income concepts are applicable. Thresholds for specific household sizes are presented in Table 2.4 Low-income measures thresholds (LIM-AT and LIM-BT) for private households of Canada  2020  Dictionary  Census of Population  2021.

When the unadjusted after-tax income of household pertaining to a person falls below the threshold applicable to the person based on household size  the person is considered to be in low income according to LIM-AT. Since the LIM-AT threshold and household income are unique within each household  low-income status based on LIM-AT can also be reported for households.

Low-income cut-offs  after tax (LICO-AT) - The Low-income cut-offs  after tax refers to an income threshold  defined using 1992 expenditure data  below which economic families or persons not in economic families would likely have devoted a larger share of their after-tax income than average to the necessities of food  shelter and clothing. More specifically  the thresholds represented income levels at which these families or persons were expected to spend 20 percentage points or more of their after-tax income than average on food  shelter and clothing. These thresholds have been adjusted to current dollars using the all-items Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The LICO-AT has 35 cut-offs varying by seven family sizes and five different sizes of area of residence to account for economies of scale and potential differences in cost of living in communities of different sizes. These thresholds are presented in Table 2.5 Low-income cut-offs  after tax (LICO-AT - 1992 base) for economic families and persons not in economic families  2020  Dictionary  Census of Population  2021.

When the after-tax income of an economic family member or a person not in an economic family falls below the threshold applicable to the person  the person is considered to be in low income according to LICO-AT. Since the LICO-AT threshold and family income are unique within each economic family  low-income status based on LICO-AT can also be reported for economic families.

Prevalence of low income - The proportion or percentage of units whose income falls below a specified low-income line.

34,Economic family after-tax income decile group - The economic family income decile group provides a rough ranking of the economic situation of a person based on his or her relative position in the Canadian distribution of the adjusted after-tax income of economic families for all persons in private households.

Using data from the 2021 Census of Population  the population in private households is sorted according to its adjusted after-tax family income and then divided into 10 equal groups each containing 10% of the population. The decile cut-points are the levels of adjusted after-tax family income that define the 10 groups.

For the 2021 Census  the reference period for income data is the calendar year 2020  unless otherwise specified.

35,The Gini coefficient  or Gini index  is a measure of inequality that indicates how equally income is distributed for a given population. It measures how much an income distribution deviates from perfect equality. Values of the Gini coefficient can range from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that income is equally divided among the population  with all units receiving exactly the same amount of income. At the opposite extreme  a Gini coefficient of 1 denotes a perfectly unequal distribution  where one unit has all of the income in the economy. 

For the census  Gini coefficients are calculated for three types of adjusted household income�market income  total income and after tax income. Adjusted income is computed by dividing the household income by a factor equal to the square root of the household size (known as the equivalence scale). This adjustment for different household sizes takes into account economies of scale. It reflects the fact that the needs of a household increase  but at a decreasing rate  as the number of members increases.
 
The P90/P10 ratio is a measure of inequality. It is the ratio of the 90th and the 10th percentile of the adjusted household after-tax income. The 90th percentile means 90% of the population has income that falls below this threshold. The 10th percentile means 10% of the population has income that falls below this threshold.
 
36,Knowledge of official languages�refers to whether the person can conduct a conversation in English only  French only  in both or in neither language. For a child who has not yet learned to speak  this includes languages that the child is learning to speak at home.

38,Mother tongue refers to the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the person at the time the data was collected. If the person no longer understands the first language learned  the mother tongue is the second language learned. For a person who learned more than one language at the same time in early childhood  the mother tongue is the language this person spoke most often at home before starting school. The person has more than one mother tongue only if they learned these languages at the same time  and still understands them. For a child who has not yet learned to speak  the mother tongue is the language spoken most often to this child at home. A child who has not yet learned to speak has more than one mother tongue only if these languages are spoken to them equally often so that the child learns these languages at the same time.

For a child who has not yet learned to speak  this is the language spoken most often to the child at home. Where more than one language is spoken to the child  the language spoken most often at home is the language spoken most often. If more than one language is spoken equally often to the child  then these languages are included here.

50,Tenure refers to whether the household owns or rents their private dwelling. The private dwelling may be situated on rented or leased land or be part of a condominium. A household is considered to own their dwelling if some member of the household owns the dwelling even if it is not fully paid for  for example if there is a mortgage or some other claim on it. A household is considered to rent their dwelling if no member of the household owns the dwelling. A household is considered to rent that dwelling even if the dwelling is provided without cash rent or at a reduced rent  or if the dwelling is part of a cooperative.
For historical and statutory reasons  shelter occupancy on Indian reserves or settlements does not lend itself to the usual classification by standard tenure categories. Therefore  a special category  'dwelling provided by the local government  First Nation or Indian band ' has been created for census purposes.

51,Condominium status refers to whether the private dwelling is part of a condominium development. A condominium is a residential complex in which dwellings are owned individually while land and common elements are held in joint ownership with others.

52,Bedrooms refers to rooms in a private dwelling that are designed mainly for sleeping purposes even if they are now used for other purposes  such as guest rooms and television rooms. Also included are rooms used as bedrooms now  even if they were not originally built as bedrooms  such as bedrooms in a finished basement. Bedrooms exclude rooms designed for another use during the day such as dining rooms and living rooms even if they may be used for sleeping purposes at night. By definition  one-room private dwellings such as bachelor or studio apartments have zero bedrooms.

53,Rooms refers to enclosed areas within a private dwelling which are finished and suitable for year round living. The number of rooms in a private dwelling includes kitchens  bedrooms and finished rooms in the attic or basement. The number of rooms in a private dwelling excludes bathrooms  halls  vestibules and rooms used solely for business purposes. Partially divided rooms are considered to be separate rooms if they are considered as such by the respondent (e.g.  L-shaped dining-room and living-room arrangements).

54,Number of persons per room - Refers to an indicator of the level of crowding in a private dwelling. It is calculated by dividing the number of persons in the household by the number of rooms in the dwelling.

55,Housing suitability refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is  whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms  as calculated using the NOS.
'Housing suitability' assesses the required number of bedrooms for a household based on the age  sex  and relationships among household members. An alternative variable  'persons per room ' considers all rooms in a private dwelling and the number of household members.
Housing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies.

56,Period of construction refers to the period in time during which the building or dwelling was originally constructed.
This refers to the period in which the building was completed  not the time of any later remodeling  additions or conversions.
For properties having multiple residential structures  this refers to the period in which the most recent structure was completed.

57,Includes data up to May 11  2021.

58,Dwelling condition refers to whether the dwelling is in need of repairs. This does not include desirable remodelling or additions.

59,Refers to whether or not a person residing in the household is responsible for paying the rent  or the mortgage  or the taxes  or the electricity or other services or utilities. Where a number of people may contribute to the payments  more than one person in the household may be identified as a household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making such payments  the reference person is identified by default.

60,Primary household maintainer - The first person in the household identified as someone who pays the rent  or the mortgage  or the taxes  or the electricity or other services or utilities for the dwelling. When more than one member of the household contributes to the payments  the first person listed is chosen as the primary household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making any such payments  the first person listed is selected by default.
The order of the persons in a household is determined by the order in which they are listed on the questionnaire. Generally  an adult is listed first followed  if applicable  by their spouse or common-law partner and then by their children. The order does not necessarily correspond to the proportion of household payments made by each person.

61,Shelter-cost-to-income ratio - Refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs.
Shelter-cost-to-income ratio is calculated for private households  who reported a total household income greater than zero.
Private households located on an agricultural operation that is operated by a member of the household  and households who reported a zero or negative total household income are excluded.
The relatively high shelter-costs-to-household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2021  while household total income is reported for the year 2020. As well  for some households  the 2020 household total income may represent income for only part of a year.
For more information on household total income or shelter costs  refer to the Census Dictionary: Total income and Shelter cost.

62,Acceptable housing refers to whether a household meets each of the three indicator thresholds established by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation for housing adequacy  suitability and affordability.Housing indicator thresholds are defined as follows:
    *Adequate housing is reported by their residents as not requiring any major repairs.
,    *Affordable housing has shelter costs equal to less than 30% of total before-tax household income.
,    *Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS)  conceived by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and provincial and territorial representatives.
,Acceptable housing identifies which thresholds the household falls below  if any. Housing that is adequate in condition  suitable in size and affordable is considered to be acceptable.
Households below and above the thresholds are based on the indicators for which individual households can be assessed. Farm and on-reserve households whose housing does not meet either or both of the suitability and adequacy thresholds are counted in the total of households below the thresholds. Farm and on-reserve households who live in housing that meets both the suitability and adequacy thresholds are counted in the total of households above the thresholds (even though it is not possible to assess housing affordability for these households). Farm households and on-reserve households cannot be assessed for housing affordability because the concept is not applicable.
Housing affordability is assessed for owner and tenant households with household total income greater than zero in non-farm  non-reserve private dwellings.

63,Core housing need refers to whether a private household's housing falls below at least one of the indicator thresholds for housing adequacy  affordability or suitability  and would have to spend 30% or more of its total before-tax income to pay the median rent of alternative local housing that is acceptable (attains all three housing indicator thresholds). Housing indicator thresholds are defined as follows: Adequate housing is reported by their residents as not requiring any major repairs. Affordable housing has shelter costs equal to less than 30% of total before-tax household income. Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS)  conceived by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and provincial and territorial representatives. Only private  non-farm  non-reserve and owner- or renter-households with incomes greater than zero and shelter-cost-to-income ratios less than 100% are assessed for 'core housing need.' Non-family households with at least one maintainer aged 15 to 29 attending school are considered not to be in 'core housing need' regardless of their housing circumstances. Attending school is considered a transitional phase  and low incomes earned by student households are viewed as being a temporary condition.

64,Presence of mortgage payments refers to whether an owner household makes regular mortgage or loan payments for their dwelling.

65,Shelter cost refers to the average monthly total of all shelter expenses paid by households.
Shelter costs for owner households include  where applicable  mortgage payments  property taxes and condominium fees  along with the costs of electricity  heat  water and other municipal services. For renter households  shelter costs include  where applicable  the rent and the costs of electricity  heat  water and other municipal services. For households living in a dwelling provided by the local government  First Nation or Indian band  shelter costs include  where applicable  the monthly use or occupancy payment and the costs of electricity  heat  water and other municipal services.

66,Value (owner estimated) refers to the dollar amount expected by the owner if the asset were to be sold.
In the context of dwelling  it refers to the value of the entire dwelling  including the value of the land it is on and of any other structure  such as a garage  which is on the property. If the dwelling is located in a building which contains several dwellings  or a combination of residential and business premises  all of which the household owns  the value is estimated as a portion of the market value that applies only to the dwelling in which the household resides.

67,Subsidized housing refers to whether a renter household lives in a dwelling that is subsidized. Subsidized housing includes rent geared to income  social housing  public housing  government-assisted housing  non-profit housing  rent supplements and housing allowances.

68,'Indigenous ancestry' refers to whether a person has ancestry associated with the Indigenous peoples of Canada  that is  First Nations (North American Indian)  M�tis  and/or Inuit.

## Economic Development Think-Tank Potential Project

## Firefly Metals and Mining in Baie Verte, Newfoundland

**Firefly Metals Ltd.** is a prominent mining company actively developing and expanding the Green Bay Copper-Gold Project in the Baie Verte district of northeast Newfoundland, Canada[1] [6] [7]. This region, long recognized for its mining heritage, is experiencing a significant revival due to Firefly’s investments and exploration activities.

### Key Assets and Operations

- **Ming Underground Mine:**
  The flagship asset of Firefly Metals, the Ming deposit, is a high-grade copper-gold Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit located approximately 9 km east of Baie Verte[1] [9]. The mine features both an upper zone of copper-gold-rich massive sulphide horizons and a substantial lower footwall copper stockwork zone, with some mineralized sections exceeding 100 meters in width and vertical extent[9].

- **Resource Estimates:**
  As of late 2024, the Green Bay project boasts a total resource of approximately 59 million tonnes, with grades averaging 1.7–2.0% copper, 0.3–0.4 grams per tonne gold, and 2.7–2.8 grams per tonne silver[6] [7] [9]. The Ming mine itself holds over 21.5 million tonnes of measured and indicated resources at 1.8% CuEq and 28.4 million tonnes of inferred resources at 2.0% CuEq[9].

- **Historical and Planned Production:**
  The Ming mine was originally mined between 1972 and 1982, with operations resuming in 2012. Historical production totaled 6.7 million tonnes at 2.0% copper[9]. Firefly aims to restart and dramatically expand production by 2028, targeting output over six times higher than previous levels[6].

- **Exploration and Expansion:**
  Firefly is executing a major 130,000-meter drilling program (2024–2025) to expand and define deeper high-grade zones, with 40,000 meters already completed by early 2025[6]. The company is also systematically testing regional targets, including the Rambler Main Mine and Little Deer exploration project, both part of the same VMS system as Ming[4] [1].

- **Processing and Infrastructure:**
  The project includes the Nugget Pond processing plant and concentrate storage at Goodyear’s Cove port, supporting efficient ore processing and export[1] [11].

### Recent Developments

- **Resource Growth:**
  In October 2024, Firefly announced a 42% increase in contained metal resources, reinforcing the project’s importance in meeting global copper and gold demand[6].

- **Acquisitions:**
  In November 2024, Firefly acquired the Tilt Cove project, expanding its footprint in the Baie Verte district by an additional 115 square kilometers[6].

- **Community Engagement:**
  Firefly has actively engaged with local communities, conducting surveys and integrating feedback on job creation, environmental stewardship, and transparency into its planning[6].

- **Environmental Assessment:**
  Plans for mine expansion, including new underground infrastructure, a processing plant, and tailings management facility, have been registered for environmental assessment, with public comment periods as recent as May 2025[3].

### Strategic Importance

- **Global Mining Jurisdiction:**
  Newfoundland and Labrador is recognized as a top-tier global mining investment jurisdiction, further supporting Firefly’s growth ambitions[1] [7].

- **Future Outlook:**
  Firefly’s strategy centers on aggressive resource growth, leveraging existing underground infrastructure to fast-track drilling and development, and positioning the Green Bay project as a globally significant source of copper and gold[1] [7] [9].

### 3. Modern Infrastructure

- Baie Verte benefits from established mining infrastructure, including processing plants (e.g., Nugget Pond), ports (Goodyear’s Cove), and a history of operational mines, which reduces capital and logistical barriers for new projects[1] [3].  
- The presence of facilities like the Pine Cove mill and in-pit tailings facility further enhances the district’s appeal for both new developments and expansions[5].

### 4. Active Exploration and Development

- The district is experiencing a surge in exploration activity, with companies undertaking large-scale drilling programs and strategic acquisitions to expand their resource base[2] [3] [5]. This includes ambitious drilling campaigns, resource upgrades, and the integration of advanced exploration technologies.

### 5. Economic and Community Impact

- Mining in Baie Verte has a strong legacy of supporting local economies through job creation, infrastructure investment, and community engagement[3] [4]. Recent projects have emphasized transparent communication and environmental stewardship, aligning with modern expectations for responsible resource development.

### 6. Alignment with Global Demand

- The district’s focus on copper and gold aligns with global trends: copper is critical for renewable energy and electrification, while gold remains a key asset for investors and industry[2]. This strategic alignment enhances the investment case for Baie Verte projects.

## Ongoing drilling at the Copper Creek prospect in Baie Verte, Newfoundland

Ongoing drilling at the Copper Creek prospect in Baie Verte, Newfoundland, has significant implications for future investment in the region, as evidenced by recent exploration activities and preliminary findings:

### Key Impacts on Investment Potential

#### 1. Resource Confirmation and Expansion

- Leocor Mining’s 2025 drilling campaign (27 holes, 3,040.5 meters) intersected **chalcopyrite** (copper ore) and **pyrite** mineralization across multiple holes, including:  
  - A 2.3-meter interval with 15% chalcopyrite and 10% pyrite [2].  
  - A 13.4-meter zone of blebby chalcopyrite [2].  
- These findings suggest the presence of **volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS)**-style mineralization, aligning with the region’s geological pedigree. Assay results pending from 1,671 samples will clarify grades, but visual estimates already indicate robust copper potential.

#### 2. Exploration Upside

- The drilling targeted a **7 km gold-copper soil anomaly** identified in 2022, with historic results up to 2,862 ppm copper and 1,601 ppb gold [3] [6]. Successful assays could validate this trend, attracting junior and major miners to adjacent claims.  
- The nearby **Dorset gold prospect** (6 holes, 732 meters) intersected quartz veins with pyrite, hinting at parallel gold opportunities [2].

#### 3. Infrastructure Synergies

- Copper Creek’s proximity to existing infrastructure—including the **Pine Cove mill** and **Goodyear’s Cove port**—lowers development costs. Confirmed resources here could integrate with Firefly Metals’ Green Bay project, creating a regional hub for copper-gold processing [6].

#### 4. Market Alignment

- Copper’s critical role in renewable energy infrastructure positions Baie Verte as a strategic investment. Confirming high-grade deposits at Copper Creek would align with global demand, potentially drawing ESG-focused investors.

#### 5. Risk Mitigation

- The Fraser Institute ranks Newfoundland among the **top four global mining jurisdictions**, reducing regulatory risks [1] [6]. Transparent community engagement and environmental assessments further enhance investor confidence.

==================== END: Economic Development Think-Tank Potential Project ====================

==================== START: could-market-or-technological-advances-alter-current-reserve-estimates ====================
# Could market or technological advances alter current reserve estimates

Yes, both **market** and **technological advances** can significantly alter current reserve estimates for gold and copper on the Baie Verte peninsula:

## Market Advances

- **Commodity Price Fluctuations:** Reserve estimates are highly sensitive to long-term gold and copper price assumptions. If market prices rise, lower-grade or previously uneconomic mineralization can become economically viable and be reclassified as reserves. Conversely, sustained price drops can render some reserves uneconomic, reducing reported figures[1] [2] [3] [4].
- **Economic Assumptions:** Changes in costs for fuel, labor, equipment, and environmental compliance—often driven by broader market trends—can shift the cut-off grade and impact the volume of ore classified as reserves[2] [5] [4].

## Technological Advances

- **Resource Discovery and Modeling:** Innovations such as AI-driven data analysis, advanced geophysical imaging (e.g., muon tomography), and machine learning can identify new mineralization, improve geological models, and reduce uncertainty in reserve estimates. These tools can help discover deeper or more complex ore bodies, leading to upward revisions in reserves[6] [7] [8] [9].
- **Precision Mining Techniques:** Technologies like sensor-enabled precision drilling and advanced ore sorting enable more efficient extraction, reduce waste, and can make lower-grade ore bodies economically viable. This can increase the amount of ore classified as reserves and extend mine life[6] [10].
- **Processing Improvements:** Advances in metallurgical processing, real-time ore characterization, and selective extraction can improve recovery rates, making it possible to economically process ores that were previously marginal or uneconomic[10].

## Combined Impact

- **Dynamic Reserve Estimates:** Reserve estimates are not static; they are regularly updated to reflect new market realities and technological capabilities. Sensitivity testing and periodic re-estimation are industry best practices to ensure that reserve figures remain accurate and relevant in changing conditions[1] [3] [4].
- **Unlocking Previously Inaccessible Resources:** As technology advances, ore bodies that were too deep, low-grade, or complex to mine profitably may become viable, leading to substantial increases in reserve estimates[7] [10].

**In summary:**  
Both market and technological advances are powerful drivers that can either increase or decrease reserve estimates, sometimes dramatically. Companies that adopt new technologies and adapt to market changes are best positioned to realize the full value of their mineral assets[6] [7] [10].

# New Technologies and Practices

The local fishing industry on the Baie Verte Peninsula is adopting several **new technologies and practices** aimed at making fishing more eco-friendly and sustainable:

- **LED-Based Bycatch Reduction Systems:** Nets equipped with LED lights have been shown to reduce sea turtle bycatch by up to 60%. This technology helps ensure that non-target species, such as turtles and some fish, are less likely to be caught, supporting both conservation and sustainable fishing[1].

- **Smart Nets and Acoustic Deterrents:** Modern nets now include escape panels, circle hooks, and acoustic devices to prevent entanglement of dolphins, whales, and other non-target species. Modified gillnets and selective gear allow smaller or unintended species to escape, which helps maintain ecosystem balance[1] [4].

- **Precision Fishing Technologies:** Tools like **GPS mapping**, **sonar systems**, and **fish finders** allow fishers to target specific species and locations more accurately. This minimizes the impact on non-target populations and reduces unnecessary bycatch[1] [4] [5].

- **Artificial Intelligence and Real-Time Monitoring:** AI-powered systems can now recognize different fish species as they are caught, providing real-time data on catch composition. This enables fishers and regulators to make timely decisions, optimize quotas, and ensure compliance with sustainability measures[3] [5] [7]. Electronic monitoring systems and cameras on vessels further enhance transparency and data collection[3] [6].

- **Drones and Remote Sensing:** Drones with high-resolution cameras are used to scout fishing areas, monitor fish populations, and observe ocean conditions. Satellite remote-sensing technology provides information on oceanographic conditions, helping fishers plan eco-friendly operations and comply with quotas[4] [6].

- **Eco-Friendly Materials:** The industry is shifting towards **biodegradable fishing lures and baits**, as well as using recycled and sustainable materials in the construction of rods, reels, and other gear. This reduces the environmental footprint of fishing activities[5].

- **Ropeless Fishing Gear:** Innovations such as ropeless traps and pots are being introduced to reduce the risk of entanglement for marine mammals, especially whales[8].

- **Cloud-Based and Traceability Tools:** Technologies now allow tracking of seafood from boat to plate, enhancing traceability and consumer confidence in sustainably sourced products[3].

These advances, combined with ecosystem-based management and community involvement, are helping the Baie Verte Peninsula fishing industry **balance productivity with environmental conservation** and adapt to changing regulations and ecological realities[1] [4] [6].

# Estimated Forestry Revenue on the Baie Verte Peninsula

## Provincial Context

The forestry industry in Newfoundland and Labrador generates approximately **$400 million annually** in economic activity. This figure includes all forest-related sectors such as pulp and paper, sawmilling, value-added manufacturing, and wood energy. The industry is a significant contributor to the provincial economy, especially in rural regions like the Baie Verte Peninsula[1] [2] [3].

## Baie Verte Peninsula Estimate

There are **no official, publicly available figures** that isolate the exact revenue generated solely from forestry activities on the Baie Verte Peninsula. However, several key points provide context:

- The Baie Verte Peninsula is part of Forest Management Zone 7, which is one of several zones contributing to the provincial forestry sector[4].
- The region is home to active sawmills and supports both commercial and domestic harvesting, but it is not the largest forestry zone in the province.
- The peninsula’s forestry sector is considered modest compared to mining and other industries in the area, and its contribution is a small fraction of the provincial total[5] [6].

## Regional Revenue Estimate

While a precise dollar value for the Baie Verte Peninsula is not published, the following **provincial and regional data** can be used to infer a rough scale:

| Area/Level                      | Estimated Annual Forestry Revenue      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Newfoundland & Labrador (total)  | ~$400 million[1] [2] [3]               |
| Baie Verte Peninsula (inferred)  | Likely a small share of provincial total; specific figures not published |

- Given the peninsula’s size and the scale of its forestry operations, it is reasonable to conclude that its direct forestry revenue is **significantly less** than the provincial figure, likely in the **low millions annually**. However, this is only an inference based on the relative size and activity of the region within the province[5] [6].

## Key Takeaways

- **No official, standalone revenue figure** for Baie Verte Peninsula forestry is available.
- The region contributes a modest but important share to the province’s $400 million forestry economy[1] [2] [3].
- Most forestry revenue in the province is generated by larger operations and mills elsewhere, with Baie Verte’s share reflecting its smaller scale and focus on local sawmilling and domestic harvesting.

For the most accurate and up-to-date figures, direct inquiries to the provincial Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture or local forestry management offices are recommended.

# Significance of the Forestry Industry to Baie Verte's Economy

## Economic Role

- **Forestry is a traditional sector** on the Baie Verte Peninsula, providing employment through logging, sawmilling, and related activities. It has historically supplemented the region’s mining and fisheries sectors.
- The industry supports both **commercial operations and domestic harvesting**, with local sawmills and firewood markets serving community and regional needs.
- **Economic diversification:** Forestry helps stabilize the local economy by providing an alternative to mining, which has experienced cycles of boom and decline.

## Relative Contribution

- **Modest share of local GDP:** Compared to mining, the forestry sector’s direct contribution to Baie Verte’s economy is relatively small. Mining remains the dominant industry, but forestry is important for rural employment and community resilience.
- **Employment impact:** Forestry jobs are especially valuable in smaller communities, where they can represent a significant portion of available year-round and seasonal work.
- **Indirect benefits:** The industry supports secondary businesses such as equipment suppliers, transport companies, and local services.

## Provincial Context

- The entire Newfoundland and Labrador forestry sector generates about **$400 million annually** in economic activity, but Baie Verte’s share is only a small fraction of this total. The peninsula is not the province’s largest forestry region, so its revenue and employment impact are limited compared to other areas.
- **Local importance:** Despite its modest scale, forestry remains vital for economic diversification and as a buffer against downturns in other industries.

## Summary Table: Forestry’s Economic Significance

| Aspect                | Details                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Direct Employment     | Logging, sawmilling, harvesting jobs                                    |
| Indirect Impact       | Supports local suppliers, transport, and services                       |

==================== START: maritime-firefly-main-factors-affecting-accuracy-of-these-reserve-valuations ====================
# What are the main factors affecting the accuracy of these reserve valuations

The **accuracy of reserve valuations** for Maritime Resources and FireFly Metals on the Baie Verte peninsula is influenced by several key factors:

- **Commodity Price Volatility:** Gold and copper prices fluctuate daily due to global economic conditions, central bank policies, geopolitical events, inflation, and market sentiment. Valuations based on current prices can change significantly with shifts in these factors[1] [2] [3].

- **Resource Classification and Confidence:** Not all reported resources are equally certain. Proven and probable reserves are more reliable than measured, indicated, or inferred resources. Early-stage or inferred resources carry much greater uncertainty, which can lead to over- or under-estimation[4] [5].

- **Geological and Technical Uncertainty:** The accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quality and density of drilling data, geological modeling, and understanding of deposit controls (structure, lithology, mineralogy, etc.). Incomplete or optimistic modeling can misrepresent the actual size, grade, or continuity of the ore body[4].

- **Metallurgical Recovery Rates:** Not all contained metal can be economically or technically recovered. Recovery rates depend on ore characteristics and processing technology, and optimistic assumptions can inflate valuations[4].

- **Economic and Regulatory Assumptions:** Valuations often assume current mining costs, tax regimes, environmental regulations, and permitting conditions will remain stable. Changes in any of these can materially alter the economic viability and thus the value of reserves[5] [4].

- **Discounting and Time Value:** In-situ values do not account for the time required to develop, mine, and process the reserves. The net present value (NPV) of a deposit can be much lower than its gross metal value due to discounting future cash flows.

- **Market Accessibility and Infrastructure:** The ability to monetize reserves depends on access to infrastructure (mills, ports, roads), regulatory approvals, and market demand. Delays or obstacles can reduce the practical value of reserves[5] [4].

In summary, **reserve valuations are inherently uncertain and sensitive to a wide range of geological, technical, economic, and market factors**. Gross in-situ values often overstate the actual economic value that can be realized from a deposit[5] [4] [3].

==================== START: maritime-firefly-new-mining-or-processing-facilities-could-nfg-and-ffm-fund-in-the-baie-verte-area ====================
# What new mining or processing facilities could NFG and FFM fund in the Baie Verte area

**NFG (New Found Gold) and FFM (FireFly Metals) are positioned to fund and enable several significant new mining and processing facilities in the Baie Verte area, either directly or through their partnerships and investments with Maritime Resources.** The following projects and facilities are either underway, proposed, or strongly enabled by these investments:

## 1. Expansion and Optimization of Processing Facilities

- **Pine Cove Mill Upgrades and Custom Processing**
  - Maritime’s Pine Cove mill, recently acquired and recommissioned, is a fully permitted gold processing facility with a capacity of 1,300–1,400 tonnes per day, a large tailings storage facility, and access to deep-water port infrastructure[1] [2].
  - NFG’s investment and memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Maritime are specifically aimed at enabling toll milling for NFG’s Queensway gold project, which could lead to further upgrades or expansion of the Pine Cove mill to handle additional throughput and different ore types[1] [3] [2].
  - Maritime’s vision includes using Pine Cove as a **regional custom mineral processing hub**, potentially importing and exporting concentrates via the port, and processing both precious and base metal ores for multiple parties[2].

- **Nugget Pond Mill Enhancements**
  - Maritime also owns the Nugget Pond mill (500 tpd), previously used for Hammerdown ore, and plans to pre-concentrate material at Hammerdown before trucking it to Nugget Pond for final processing[2].
  - Future investments could see further upgrades or reconfiguration of Nugget Pond to process additional types of ore, especially as more regional projects come online.

## 2. New Mining Infrastructure and Expansions

- **Green Bay Copper-Gold Project Expansion (FFM)**
  - FireFly Metals is actively expanding its Green Bay project, which includes the Ming underground mine, Little Deer, and the recently acquired Tilt Cove project[4] [5] [6] [7].
  - FFM is proposing a major expansion at Ming’s Bight, with plans for new **underground mining infrastructure, a modern processing plant, tailings management facility, roads, transmission lines, storage, and accommodations**[4] [8].
  - The new processing plant is planned to be right-sized at **1.8 million tonnes per annum**, correcting the previous mismatch between resource size and plant capacity. This facility will be constructed on-site, eliminating the need for long-distance ore transport and optimizing operational efficiency[8].
  - FFM’s investments also support ongoing and future exploration, with a 130,000-meter drilling program and multiple new regional targets being developed[6] [7].

## 3. Port and Logistics Infrastructure

- **Deep-Water Port Facility**
  - Maritime’s acquisition of the Pine Cove port is a key enabler for both NFG and FFM. FFM has secured long-term rights to export up to 1 million tonnes of mineral concentrate per year through this port, and is expected to build storage and handling facilities on-site[2].
  - This infrastructure dramatically reduces logistics costs and opens the door for further export-oriented mining projects in the district.

## 4. District-Scale Exploration and Development

- **New Discoveries and Satellite Deposits**
  - Both FFM and NFG’s investments are supporting aggressive exploration programs, including at the Green Bay project, Little Deer, Tilt Cove, and other VMS and orogenic gold targets identified by FireFly Metals[7].
  - As new discoveries are made, additional satellite mines and processing facilities could be developed, all leveraging the central processing and port infrastructure now controlled by Maritime and its partners.

## Summary Table: Potential New Facilities Enabled by NFG and FFM Investments

| Facility/Project                           | Lead Company      | Type/Function                           | Status/Impact                                  |

==================== START: maritime-firefly-recent-developments-that-could-significantly-alter-these-reserve-estimates ====================
# Are there any recent developments that could significantly alter these reserve estimates

Yes, there are several **recent developments** that could significantly alter the reserve estimates for both Maritime Resources and FireFly Metals on the Baie Verte peninsula:

- **Aggressive and Successful Drilling Programs:**  
  - **FireFly Metals** has completed extensive drilling at the Ming Mine and the broader Green Bay Copper-Gold Project, with over 79,200 meters drilled by mid-2025 and a total 130,000-meter program underway[1] [2] [3] [4]. This drilling has focused on resource extension, infill, and new discovery targets, with recent results indicating continuous high-grade copper and gold mineralization and the identification of a 700-meter conductive anomaly suggesting substantial untapped potential[2] [4].  
  - **Maritime Resources** has also reported high-grade gold intercepts from grade control and exploration drilling at the Hammerdown Gold Project in 2025, including results such as 49.4 g/t gold over 2.6 meters and 19.9 g/t gold over 17 meters[5] [6]. These results are expected to inform updated resource models.

- **Pending and Upcoming Resource Updates:**  
  - **FireFly Metals** is planning resource estimate updates in the second quarter of 2025, which are likely to incorporate additional high-grade copper and gold from recent drilling and may convert significant portions of Inferred Resources to the higher-confidence Measured and Indicated categories[1] [2] [3] [4].  
  - **Maritime Resources** is preparing an updated technical report in the second half of 2025 to capture recent drilling results and project enhancements at Hammerdown[7].

- **Discovery of New Mineralized Zones and Geophysical Anomalies:**  
  - FireFly’s geophysical surveys (DHEM) have identified new conductive anomalies beyond current drilling, pointing to the potential for additional resource growth at depth and along strike[2] [4].  
  - Both companies continue to test new targets and extensions, with FireFly also drilling at the Rambler Main and East Mines, which remain open and underexplored[4].

- **Resource Conversion and Expansion:**  
  - FireFly’s infill and validation drilling is aimed at upgrading large volumes of Inferred Resources to Measured and Indicated status, which would increase the confidence and potentially the size of the economic resource base[3] [4].  
  - Maritime’s ongoing exploration and near-mine drilling could add new ounces to its reserve base and improve mine planning[7] [6].

**In summary:**

- **Reserve and resource estimates for both companies are expected to increase and/or become more reliable in the near future** due to successful drilling, new discoveries, and upcoming technical updates.
- These developments could significantly alter current valuations, as they may add new resources, upgrade the confidence of existing resources, and extend mine lives[1] [5] [2] [3] [4] [7] [6].

**The most significant factors are the scale and success of 2024–2025 drilling campaigns, new geophysical discoveries, and the imminent release of updated resource estimates by both Maritime and FireFly Metals.**

==================== START: maritime-future-projects-enabled-by-the-investments-from-NFG-and-FFM ====================
# What future projects could be enabled by the investments from NFG and FFM

**Investments from New Found Gold (NFG) and FireFly Metals (FFM) are enabling Maritime Resources to pursue a range of future projects and strategic initiatives in the Baie Verte district. These investments and partnerships provide capital, operational flexibility, and infrastructure access that open up several key opportunities:**

## 1. Expansion of Custom Mineral Processing

- **Toll Milling for Regional Projects:** The MOU with NFG gives Maritime the opportunity to process ore from NFG’s Queensway project at the Pine Cove mill, potentially generating new revenue streams through toll milling agreements[1] [2]. This sets a precedent for Maritime to become a regional processing hub for other gold and base metal projects in Newfoundland[3].

## 2. Accelerated Development of Hammerdown and Satellite Deposits

- **Faster, Lower-Cost Start-Up:** The acquisition and upgrade of the Pine Cove mill—supported by NFG and FFM investments—allow Maritime to bring the Hammerdown project online more quickly and at a lower capital cost than previously planned[3] [4] [5]. The infrastructure also supports the integration of nearby deposits like Orion and Stoger Tight into future production plans[6].

## 3. Infrastructure-Driven Growth

- **Port and Logistics Expansion:** FFM’s investment and the port access agreement enable Maritime to leverage the Pine Cove deepwater port for the export of mineral concentrates, not only for its own products but also for third parties such as FFM’s Green Bay Copper-Gold Project[7] [8]. This positions Maritime as a critical logistics and export hub for the district, with the potential to handle up to 1 million tonnes of concentrate annually for FFM alone[7] [8].

## 4. District Consolidation and Exploration

- **Acquisition and Exploration of New Properties:** With enhanced financial resources, Maritime can pursue additional property acquisitions and exploration across its 450 km² land package, targeting both gold and base metals[3]. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the resurgence of mining activity in Newfoundland, potentially consolidating further assets and discoveries in the Baie Verte district[3].

## 5. Enhanced Operational Flexibility

- **Multiple Processing Routes:** Ownership of both the Pine Cove and Nugget Pond mills gives Maritime unique flexibility to process a variety of ores and concentrates, including those from third parties, and to optimize logistics and recoveries for its own projects[3] [6].

## 6. Potential for Early Cash Flow and De-Risking

- **Stockpile and Tailings Processing:** The capital infusion allows Maritime to process existing mineralized stockpiles and tailings, generating early cash flow and reducing risk ahead of full-scale mine development[5].

**In summary, investments from NFG and FFM are enabling Maritime Resources to:**

- Fast-track Hammerdown and related projects
- Establish a regional processing and export hub
- Pursue custom milling and concentrate handling for other miners
- Expand exploration and acquisition efforts in the Baie Verte district
- Enhance operational flexibility and reduce startup risk

These initiatives collectively support Maritime’s vision of consolidating and developing Baie Verte into a major, multi-commodity mining district[3] [7] [2].

# Maritime Gold Company Operations in Baie Verte, Newfoundland

**Maritime Resources Corp.** is a gold exploration and development company with significant operations in the Baie Verte mining district of Newfoundland and Labrador. The company’s activities are centered around the Hammerdown Gold Project and supported by a robust portfolio of exploration and processing assets in the region.

## Key Projects and Assets

- **Hammerdown Gold Project**:
  - Located near the towns of King’s Point and Springdale, Hammerdown is the company’s flagship development. The site was a past-producing underground mine (2000–2004) that yielded 133,000 ounces of gold. Maritime Resources is now advancing plans to restart Hammerdown as a high-grade open pit operation, with a projected mine life of five years and annual production estimates of around 50,000 ounces [1] [2].
  - The project is fully permitted, with all major environmental and operational approvals in place. Development, ramp-up, and initial cash flow are targeted for the second half of 2025 [3] [4].
  - Recent grade control drilling has confirmed high-grade gold at surface, including notable intersections such as 49.4 grams per tonne (g/t) gold over 2.6 metres and 12.0 g/t gold over 28.0 metres, underscoring the project’s strong resource potential[3] [5].

- **Processing Facilities**:
  - Maritime owns and operates two key mineral processing assets in the Baie Verte district: the Pine Cove mill and the Nugget Pond gold circuit. The Pine Cove mill has recently been recommissioned and began processing mineralized stockpiles in early 2025, marking the first gold recovery under Maritime’s ownership[3] [4] [6].
  - The company is investing in upgrades to the Pine Cove mill, including enhancements to the material handling and grinding circuits, to optimize processing for Hammerdown ore[4].

- **Exploration Portfolio**:
  - Maritime controls over 439–450 km² of prospective land in the Baie Verte area, including the Green Bay, Whisker Valley, Gull Ridge, and Point Rousse projects. This region is geologically significant, hosting numerous past-producing mines and current development projects for gold and copper[7] [3].
  - The company’s properties are strategically situated along major regional fault systems (Baie Verte Fault Line and Green Bay Fault), which are believed to have played a crucial role in the formation of high-grade gold deposits[7].

## Financial and Operational Highlights

- Maritime recently closed a $20 million equity financing, providing the capital needed for project development and operational ramp-up at a time of record gold prices[3].
- The Hammerdown project’s 2022 technical report outlined proven and probable reserves of 272,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 4.46 g/t, with robust project economics—an after-tax net present value (NPV) of C$103 million (at $1,750/oz gold) and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 48%. At higher gold prices, the NPV and IRR are even more favorable[1].

## Outlook

Maritime Resources is well-positioned for near-term production and cash flow, with fully permitted assets, a strong exploration pipeline, and significant processing infrastructure in place. The company’s focus on the Baie Verte mining district leverages the region’s established mining infrastructure and favorable geology, supporting its strategy for sustainable growth and value creation[3] [4] [7].

In summary, Maritime Resources Corp. is advancing one of Newfoundland’s most promising gold development projects, with operations in Baie Verte poised to contribute significantly to regional gold output in the coming years.

# How is Maritime Resources advancing its operations in Baie Verte

Maritime Resources is **advancing its operations in Baie Verte** through a multi-pronged strategy focused on mine development, processing infrastructure, and regional exploration:

- **Hammerdown Gold Project Advancement**: Maritime has completed a **grade control drill program** over the first year of planned open-pit mining at Hammerdown, with positive results confirming the resource model and supporting mine planning. The project is fully permitted, and the company is targeting development and initial cash flow in 2025[1] [4].

- **Pine Cove Mill Re-commissioning and Processing**: The company acquired the Pine Cove mill and in-pit tailings storage facility as part of the Point Rousse Project. In 2025, Maritime began **processing mineralized stockpiles** at Pine Cove, generating its first gold production from existing materials. The mill has undergone significant **equipment upgrades, mechanical and electrical inspections, and recruitment of experienced personnel** to ensure efficient and safe operations. Investments are ongoing to improve material handling and grinding circuits to prepare for Hammerdown ore[1] [6].

- **Stockpile and Tailings Processing**: Maritime has identified and is processing **85,000–115,000 tonnes of mineralized stockpiles and tailings**, grading about 1.1 grams per tonne gold, for an estimated 3,000–4,000 ounces of contained gold. This provides early cash flow and operational ramp-up ahead of Hammerdown’s full-scale mining[6].

- **Strategic Partnerships and Financing**: The company has secured **$20 million in equity financing** to fund development, and has established partnerships with other regional players such as New Found Gold and Firefly Metals to leverage infrastructure and operational synergies[1] [4] [5].

- **Land Position and Exploration**: Maritime controls over **439–450 km²** of highly prospective land in the Baie Verte mining district, including the Green Bay, Whisker Valley, Gull Ridge, and Point Rousse projects. This extensive land package positions the company for future growth through exploration and potential new discoveries[3] [10].

- **Sustainable Operations and Community Engagement**: The company is working with local contractors and partners (e.g., Shoreline Aggregates) for reclamation and tailings management, and is committed to responsible environmental practices and local employment[6] [9].

In summary, Maritime Resources is rapidly advancing its Baie Verte operations by bringing the Hammerdown Gold Project toward production, re-commissioning and upgrading the Pine Cove mill, processing stockpiled material for early cash flow, expanding its exploration footprint, and leveraging strategic partnerships and financing to support sustainable, long-term growth[1] [4] [6].

- **Toll Milling Agreement:** Maritime and NFG signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) granting NFG exclusivity to negotiate a toll processing agreement at the Pine Cove mill. This arrangement would allow NFG to process ore from its Queensway project at Maritime’s facility, maximizing the use of existing infrastructure and generating processing revenue for Maritime[1] [4] [2] [3].
- **Strategic Infrastructure Use:** The partnership exemplifies Maritime’s vision of leveraging its processing assets for custom mineral processing, supporting both its own projects and those of regional partners, while minimizing environmental impacts by utilizing established facilities[1] [5] [4] [2].

## FireFly Metals (FFM)

- **Equity Investment:** FFM took an 8.4% (non-diluted) equity stake in Maritime, providing additional capital for project development and strengthening Maritime’s balance sheet[6] [7] [8].
- **Port Access Agreement:** FFM secured a long-term agreement to use Maritime’s Pine Cove deepwater port, granting the right to export up to 1 million tonnes of mineral concentrate annually. This provides FFM’s Green Bay Copper-Gold Project with a cost-effective, nearby export route and positions Maritime as a key logistics hub in the district[6] [7].
- **Operational Synergy:** The agreement allows FFM to build storage and handling facilities on Maritime’s property and ensures coordinated use of the port and related infrastructure, enhancing operational efficiency for both companies[6] [7].
- **District Consolidation:** FFM’s investment and collaboration reflect confidence in Maritime’s regional consolidation strategy and support the vision of Baie Verte as a major, multi-commodity mining district[5] [7] [8].

## Strategic Impact

| Partnership | Role in Maritime’s Strategy | Key Benefits |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **NFG**     | Lead investor, toll milling MOU | Capital for acquisitions, processing revenue, infrastructure utilization, industry collaboration |
| **FFM**     | Equity investor, port access partner | Capital injection, logistics revenue, infrastructure sharing, district development synergy |

**In summary, partnerships with NFG and FFM provide Maritime with critical funding, maximize the value of its processing and port assets, and position the company as a central player in the consolidation and development of the Baie Verte mining district**[1] [6] [5] [4] [7] [2] [8] [3].

# Experiencing Untouched Coastal Landscapes and Remote Beaches on the Baie Verte Peninsula

The Baie Verte Peninsula is renowned for its **untouched wilderness**, dramatic coastal scenery, and hidden beaches. Here’s how you can immerse yourself in these pristine environments:

## 1. Explore Coastal Hiking Trails

Several community-maintained trails provide access to remote viewpoints and unspoiled shorelines:

- **Ocean View Trail (Fleur de Lys)**  
  - A 1.1 km out-and-back trail leading through woods to a scenic platform overlooking the Atlantic. It’s ideal for whale and iceberg watching, and you’ll likely have the trail to yourself, especially in the shoulder seasons[1] [2].
- **Spotted Point Trail (Fleur de Lys)**
  - A 2 km hike to a rocky headland with dramatic cliff views and seasonal iceberg sightings. Benches and picnic tables make it a pleasant spot to linger[2].
- **French Island Trail (Coachman’s Cove)**
  - This 1.6 km trail winds through woods to secluded rocky coves, where you’ll find sea glass, shells, and, at low tide, the opportunity to walk to French Island. The area is especially peaceful and rarely crowded[3].
- **Caplin Cove Trail (La Scie)**
  - Follows the shoreline from a campground to a fishing dock, offering great views as you descend toward the water[4].
- **La Scie Community Trails**
  - Five trails in La Scie lead to beaches, lookouts, and capes, each providing a different perspective on the peninsula’s rugged coast[3] [5].

## 2. Seek Out Remote Beaches

- **La Scie Beach**
  - Accessible via steps from the town, this beach is a quiet spot where you may see seabirds, capelin eggs, and the raw beauty of the North Atlantic. It’s a favorite among those seeking solitude and a connection to nature[5].
- **Hidden Coves and Inlets**
  - The peninsula’s coastline is dotted with small, often unnamed coves and inlets. Trails like the French Island Trail and Caplin Cove Trail lead to these secluded spots, perfect for a peaceful picnic or quiet contemplation[3] [4].

## 3. Go Off the Beaten Path

- **Guided and Self-Guided Tours**
  - Local operators and community guides offer off-the-beaten-path experiences, focusing on the untouched nature, iceberg viewing, and birdwatching. These tours can introduce you to areas not widely known or marked on maps, such as sea caves and panoramic headlands[6].
- **DIY Adventure**
  - With a map and a sense of adventure, you can explore lesser-known routes and beaches. Many communities, like Pacquet, Coachman’s Cove, and Fleur de Lys, have signage for local trails leading to the water[3] [2].

## 4. When to Visit

- **Late Spring to Early Summer**
  - This is the best time for iceberg and whale watching along the coast.
- **Early Fall**
  - Fewer visitors and vibrant autumn colors make for an especially tranquil experience.

## 5. Tips for a True Wilderness Experience

- **Pack Out What You Pack In:** These areas are pristine—help keep them that way.
- **Check Local Conditions:** Trails and beach access can change with weather and tides.
- **Respect Wildlife:** The peninsula is home to seabirds, seals, and sometimes moose near the shore.

==================== START: why-baie-verte-estimated-present-day-value-maratime-fire-fly-metals ====================
# What is the estimated present day value of maritime and firefly metals gold and copper reserves on the Baie Verte peninsula?

The **present-day estimated value** of Maritime Resources’ and FireFly Metals’ gold and copper reserves on the Baie Verte peninsula is approximately **$1.30 trillion USD**. This estimate is based on current market prices and the most recent reserve/resource figures for each company:

| Company             | Metal   | Reserve/Resource Estimate            | Price (July 2025)       | Present Value (USD)       |
|---------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Maritime Resources  | Gold    | 272,000 ounces                       | $3,338/oz[1] [2]         | $907,936,000              |
| FireFly Metals      | Copper  | 30.2 million tonnes @ 1.81% Cu       | $9,835/tonne[3]         | $5,376,008,000            |
| FireFly Metals      | Gold    | ~387,200,000 ounces (in copper ore)* | $3,338/oz[1] [2]         | $1,290,337,000,000         |

*Calculated from FireFly’s copper resource tonnage and average gold grade (0.4 g/t).

- **Total combined estimated value:** **$1,296,621,000,000** (about $1.30 trillion USD).

**Key notes:**

- These figures represent in-situ metal values and do not account for recovery rates, mining/processing costs, royalties, or other economic factors that would affect actual realized value.
- FireFly’s gold figure is derived from the gold content within its copper ore, not standalone gold deposits.
- Both companies are actively drilling and expanding their resources, so these numbers may increase with future exploration success[4] [5] [6] [7].

**Summary:**  
At current gold and copper prices, the Baie Verte peninsula hosts reserves/resources for Maritime and FireFly Metals with a combined estimated gross value of about **$1.30 trillion USD**, overwhelmingly dominated by FireFly’s gold content within its copper-gold ore.
