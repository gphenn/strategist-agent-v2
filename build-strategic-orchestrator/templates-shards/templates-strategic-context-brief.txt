## Instructions for Step-Based Workflow

This strategic context brief serves as the master project context. Individual step work is managed through dedicated step context briefs located in `project-context/{step-name}-context-brief.md`.

**Workflow Overview:**

1. **Step Selection**: User selects next step from Framework Sequence
2. **Persona Activation**: System activates appropriate persona for that step  
3. **Step Context Management**: System loads/creates step-specific context brief
4. **Work Execution**: All work tracked at step level with cross-step integration

**Step-to-Persona Mapping:**

- Step 1 (Define) → Strategic Analyst
- Step 2 (Split) → Strategic Specialist  
- Step 3 (Analyse) → Strategic Analyst OR Strategic Specialist
- Step 4 (Insight) → Strategic Communicator
- Step 5 (Story) → Strategic Communicator
- Step 6 (Decide) → Strategic Advisor
- Step 7 (Act) → Strategic Advisor + Strategic Innovator

**Getting Started:**

- Review Framework Sequence and select starting step
- System will activate appropriate persona and manage step context brief
- Strategic modules are applied at the step level based on step-specific relevance
