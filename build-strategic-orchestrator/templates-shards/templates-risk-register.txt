**Risk Owner:** [Name and Role of primary risk manager]  
**Register Version:** [Version Number]  
**Last Updated:** [Date]  
**Review Frequency:** [Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly]  
**Next Review Date:** [Date]

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Categories

- **Strategic Risks:** Market changes, competitive threats, business model risks
- **Operational Risks:** Process failures, resource constraints, execution risks
- **Financial Risks:** Budget overruns, revenue shortfalls, cash flow issues
- **Technology Risks:** System failures, cybersecurity, technical feasibility
- **Regulatory Risks:** Compliance failures, regulatory changes, legal issues
- **Reputational Risks:** Brand damage, stakeholder confidence, public relations
- **Human Resources Risks:** Key person dependency, talent retention, skill gaps
- **External Risks:** Economic conditions, natural disasters, supplier issues

### Risk Scoring Matrix

**Probability Scale (1-5):**

- **1 - Very Low:** 0-5% chance of occurring
- **2 - Low:** 6-25% chance of occurring  
- **3 - Medium:** 26-50% chance of occurring
- **4 - High:** 51-75% chance of occurring
- **5 - Very High:** 76-100% chance of occurring

**Impact Scale (1-5):**

- **1 - Negligible:** Minimal impact on objectives
- **2 - Minor:** Small impact, easily managed
- **3 - Moderate:** Noticeable impact requiring management attention
- **4 - Major:** Significant impact affecting key objectives
- **5 - Severe:** Critical impact threatening project/business success

**Risk Level Calculation:** Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact (1-25 scale)

**Risk Priority Levels:**

- **Critical (20-25):** Immediate action required
- **High (15-19):** Urgent attention needed
- **Medium (8-14):** Monitor and manage actively
- **Low (4-7):** Monitor periodically
- **Very Low (1-3):** Minimal monitoring required
