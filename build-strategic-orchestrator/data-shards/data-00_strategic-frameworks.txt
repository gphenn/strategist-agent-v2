## Core Strategic Analysis Frameworks

### Porter's Five Forces Model

**Purpose:** Assess industry attractiveness and competitive positioning

1. **Threat of New Entrants** - Barriers to entry, capital requirements
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** - Supplier concentration, switching costs  
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers** - Buyer concentration, price sensitivity
4. **Threat of Substitutes** - Alternative solutions, switching costs
5. **Competitive Rivalry** - Number of competitors, growth rate, differentiation

**Application:** Use in Step 3 (Analyse) for competitive environment assessment

### SWOT Analysis Framework

**Purpose:** Internal and external strategic factor analysis

- **Strengths** - Internal positive factors and capabilities
- **Weaknesses** - Internal limitations and areas for improvement
- **Opportunities** - External positive trends and possibilities  
- **Threats** - External negative trends and competitive pressures

**Application:** Use in Step 3 (Analyse) for comprehensive situation assessment

### Financial Analysis Framework

**Purpose:** Quantitative evaluation of strategic options

**Net Present Value (NPV):**

```text
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow_t / (1 + r)^t] - Initial Investment
```

**Key Metrics:**

- **ROI** - Return on Investment
- **IRR** - Internal Rate of Return  
- **Payback Period** - Time to recover investment
- **Sensitivity Analysis** - Impact of key variable changes

**Application:** Use in Step 3 (Analyse) and Step 6 (Decide) for financial validation

## Strategic Decision-Making Frameworks

### Decision Matrix Framework

**Purpose:** Systematic evaluation of multiple options against multiple criteria

**Process:**

1. Define decision criteria and relative weights
2. Score each option against each criterion (1-10 scale)
3. Calculate weighted scores: (Score × Weight) for each criterion
4. Sum weighted scores for each option
5. Rank options by total weighted score

**Application:** Use in Step 6 (Decide) for complex multi-criteria decisions

### Trade-off Analysis Framework  

**Purpose:** Explicit evaluation of competing priorities and constraints

**Process:**

1. Identify key trade-off dimensions (e.g., speed vs quality, cost vs features)
2. Map options on trade-off space
3. Evaluate stakeholder preferences for each dimension
4. Identify options that optimize across trade-offs
5. Make explicit choices and rationale

**Application:** Use in Step 6 (Decide) when facing difficult choices

### Risk Assessment Framework

**Purpose:** Systematic identification and mitigation of strategic risks

**Risk Matrix:**

- **Probability** - Low, Medium, High likelihood (1-3 scale)
- **Impact** - Low, Medium, High consequence (1-3 scale)  
- **Risk Score** - Probability × Impact

**Response Strategies:**

- **High Risk (7-9)** - Immediate mitigation required
- **Medium Risk (4-6)** - Monitor and prepare contingencies
- **Low Risk (1-3)** - Accept and monitor

**Application:** Use in Step 6 (Decide) and Step 7 (Act) for risk management

## Strategic Communication Frameworks

### Pyramid Principle Framework

**Purpose:** Structure complex strategic reasoning for executive communication

**Structure:**

- **Top Level** - Main conclusion/recommendation
- **Second Level** - 3-5 key supporting arguments  
- **Third Level** - Evidence and data supporting each argument
- **Logic Flow** - Each level answers "why" or "how" for level above

**Application:** Use in Step 5 (Story) for executive presentations

### SCQA Framework

**Purpose:** Create compelling strategic narratives

- **Situation** - Context and background
- **Complication** - Problem or challenge  
- **Question** - What should we do?
- **Answer** - Strategic recommendation

**Application:** Use in Step 4 (Insight) and Step 5 (Story) for narrative structure

---

## Implementation Planning Frameworks

### Action Planning Canvas

**Purpose:** Translate strategic decisions into executable plans

**Components:**

- **Objective** - Clear, measurable goal
- **Key Actions** - Specific steps required
- **Owners** - Who is responsible for each action
- **Timeline** - When actions will be completed
- **Success Metrics** - How success will be measured
- **Dependencies** - What must happen first
- **Resources** - What resources are required

**Application:** Use in Step 7 (Act) for implementation planning

### Innovation Opportunity Framework

**Purpose:** Identify areas for breakthrough value creation

**Opportunity Types:**

- **Process Innovation** - New ways of delivering value
- **Product Innovation** - New solutions to customer problems
- **Business Model Innovation** - New ways of capturing value
- **Market Innovation** - New customer segments or use cases

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- **Strategic Fit** - Alignment with core capabilities
- **Market Potential** - Size and attractiveness of opportunity
- **Competitive Advantage** - Defensibility and differentiation
- **Implementation Feasibility** - Resource requirements and timeline

**Application:** Use in Step 7 (Act) to maximize strategic value creation

## Framework Selection Decision Tree

```text
Strategic Challenge Type:
├── Market/Competitive Analysis → Porter's Five Forces, SWOT
├── Financial Evaluation → NPV/IRR, Sensitivity Analysis  
├── Complex Decisions → Decision Matrix, Trade-off Analysis
├── Problem Solving → Issue Trees, Root Cause Analysis
├── Communication → Pyramid Principle, SCQA
├── Implementation → Action Planning, Risk Assessment
└── Innovation → Opportunity Mapping, Business Model Canvas
```

**Usage Guidelines:**

1. **Start with methodology step** - Each step has recommended frameworks
2. **Consider challenge complexity** - Use simpler frameworks for straightforward issues
3. **Adapt to context** - Modify frameworks based on industry and situation
4. **Combine frameworks** - Use multiple frameworks for comprehensive analysis
5. **Focus on outcomes** - Choose frameworks that drive actionable insights
