### 2. Framework Sequence Determination & Strategic Context Brief Management

**Once sufficient context is gathered and modules are selected:**

#### Check for Existing Strategic Context Brief

**File Check Protocol:**

1. **Check if `project-context/strategic-context-brief.md` exists**
2. **If file exists**:
   - Load and review existing content with user
   - Ask: "I found your existing strategic context brief. Would you like me to review and update it based on our conversation, or shall we proceed with the current framework sequence?"
   - If user requests updates: Update relevant sections based on new information gathered
   - If user wants to proceed: Load existing Framework Sequence and continue to persona activation

3. **If file does not exist**: Proceed to Framework Sequence Determination (below)

#### Framework Sequence Determination Logic

**Based on selected strategic modules and user context, determine optimal Framework Sequence:**

**Reference Framework Sequences from Active Modules:**

- Load success patterns from activated strategic modules (e.g., `20_mining-services_economic-development-module.md`)
- Analyze user challenge against known patterns
- Consider project characteristics: urgency, complexity, stakeholder diversity, timeline constraints

**Common Framework Sequence Patterns:**

1. **Market Analysis First Pattern** (Market-driven challenges):
   - **Sequence**: Step 3 (Analyse) → Step 1 (Define) → Step 6 (Decide) → Step 5 (Story)
   - **When to use**: Market opportunities, competitive positioning, business development
   - **Example**: "You need market intelligence before defining specific objectives"

2. **Stakeholder Alignment First Pattern** (Complex stakeholder environments):
   - **Sequence**: Step 5 (Story) → Step 3 (Analyse) → Step 6 (Decide) → Step 2 (Split)
   - **When to use**: Multi-stakeholder projects, community development, public-private partnerships
   - **Example**: "Stakeholder consensus is prerequisite to effective analysis"

3. **Problem Decomposition Pattern** (Complex systematic challenges):
   - **Sequence**: Step 2 (Split) → Step 3 (Analyse) → Step 4 (Insight) → Step 6 (Decide)
   - **When to use**: Complex operational challenges, system redesign, organizational transformation
   - **Example**: "Need to break down complexity before meaningful analysis"

4. **Innovation-Driven Pattern** (Breakthrough opportunities):
   - **Sequence**: Step 4 (Insight) → Step 7 (Act) → Step 3 (Analyse) → Step 6 (Decide)
   - **When to use**: Disruptive innovation, new market creation, breakthrough solutions
   - **Example**: "Creative insight should drive analysis rather than follow it"

5. **Crisis Response Pattern** (Urgent situations):
   - **Sequence**: Step 1 (Define) → Step 6 (Decide) → Step 7 (Act) → Step 3 (Analyse)
   - **When to use**: Crisis management, urgent competitive threats, regulatory compliance
   - **Example**: "Speed to decision and action is critical, analysis follows"

#### Framework Sequence Selection Process

##### Step 1: Pattern Matching

- Map user context against pattern indicators
- Consider activated strategic modules' recommended sequences
- Assess primary success factors for user's specific challenge

##### Step 2: Sequence Customization

- Adapt base pattern to user's specific constraints
- Consider whether all 7 steps are necessary or if subset is optimal
- Factor in timeline, resources, and stakeholder requirements

##### Step 3: User Validation

- Present recommended Framework Sequence with clear rationale
- Explain why this sequence is optimal for their specific situation
- Provide Context, Approach, Success Factors, and Framework Sequence
- Ask for user approval or modifications

**Example Presentation:**

```text
Based on your [challenge type] with [key constraints], I recommend the [Pattern Name]:

**Context**: [Why this pattern fits their situation]
**Approach**: [How this sequence works for their challenge]
**Success Factors**: [What will make this sequence effective]
**Framework Sequence**: [Specific step sequence]

This sequence will [primary benefit] while [addressing specific constraint].

Do you want to proceed with this Framework Sequence, or would you like me to explain alternative approaches?
```

#### Create Strategic Context Brief

**If context brief doesn't exist, create using enhanced template:**

1. **Create project-context directory** if it doesn't exist
2. **Populate Standard Sections**:
   - Situation Summary, Challenge Description, Stakeholders, Desired Outcomes, Known Constraints, Information Gaps, User Signals & Preferences

3. **Populate Framework Sequence Sections**:
   - Selected Pattern, Rationale, Context, Approach, Success Factors, Framework Sequence

4. **Save and Present**:
   - Save completed strategic-context-brief.md to project-context/ folder
   - Present summary to user for approval
   - Confirm readiness to proceed to persona activation with this sequence

#### Update Existing Strategic Context Brief

**If context brief exists:**

1. **Review Current Content**: Load and assess existing strategic context brief
2. **Identify Updates Needed**: Compare against new conversation insights
3. **Update Relevant Sections**: Modify any sections that need updating based on new information
4. **Reassess Framework Sequence**: Determine if sequence should be modified based on new insights
5. **Present Changes**: Show user what sections were updated and why
6. **Confirm Proceeding**: Verify user wants to continue with current or updated Framework Sequence
