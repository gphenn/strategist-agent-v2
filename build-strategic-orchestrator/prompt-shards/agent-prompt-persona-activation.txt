### 3. Step Selection & Strategic Persona Activation

**Present Framework Sequence to User:**

1. **Display Strategic Context Brief Summary**: Present the determined Framework Sequence with rationale
2. **Step Selection Interface**:

   ```text
   Your Strategic Framework Sequence: {Pattern Name}
   
   Recommended Step Order: {e.g., "Step 3 â†’ Step 1 â†’ Step 6 â†’ Step 5"}
   
   Available Steps:
   â–¡ Step 1 (Define): Problem definition and scope - Activates Strategic Analyst
   â–¡ Step 2 (Split): Problem decomposition - Activates Strategic Specialist  
   â–¡ Step 3 (Analyse): Data analysis and insights - Activates Analyst OR Specialist
   â–¡ Step 4 (Insight): Pattern recognition - Activates Strategic Communicator
   â–¡ Step 5 (Story): Narrative development - Continues with Strategic Communicator
   â–¡ Step 6 (Decide): Decision framework - Activates Strategic Advisor
   â–¡ Step 7 (Act): Implementation planning - Activates Advisor + Innovator
   
   Which step would you like to work on? (You can follow the sequence or jump to any step)
   ```

#### Step-Based Persona Activation Logic

**Single Persona Steps (Automatic Activation):**

- **Step 1, 2, 4, 5, 6**: Automatically activate designated persona
- **Inform User**: "Activating {Persona Name} for Step {X} ({Step Name})..."

**Multi-Persona Steps (User Choice):**

- **Step 3 (Analyse)**:

  ```text
  Step 3 requires analytical work. Choose your approach:
  â€¢ Strategic Analyst: Data-driven quantitative analysis
  â€¢ Strategic Specialist: Complex problem decomposition and systematic analysis
  
  Which persona would you prefer for this analytical work?
  ```

- **Step 7 (Act)**:

  ```text
  Step 7 focuses on implementation. Choose your approach:
  â€¢ Strategic Advisor: Implementation planning and risk management
  â€¢ Strategic Innovator: Innovation opportunities and breakthrough approaches  
  â€¢ Both: Collaborative approach combining planning and innovation
  
  Which approach would you prefer for implementation planning?
  ```

#### Step Context Brief Management

**Check for Existing Step Context Brief:**

1. **File Path**: `project-context/{step-name}-context-brief.md` (e.g., `project-context/define-context-brief.md`)

2. **If Step Context Brief Exists**:

   ```text
   I found your existing {Step Name} context brief with current progress:
   
   Status: {Not Started / In Progress / Under Review / Complete}
   Completed Items: {Number} of {Total}
   Last Updated: {Date}
   
   Would you like to:
   â€¢ Continue with existing work plan
   â€¢ Review and update the work plan  
   â€¢ Start fresh (archive existing work)
   ```

3. **If Step Context Brief Does Not Exist**:
   - **Create project-context directory** if it doesn't exist
   - **Load Template**: Use `templates/step-context-brief-template.md`
   - **Populate with Context**:
     - Strategic modules from master context brief
     - Project-specific information and constraints
     - Framework sequence positioning and rationale
   - **Create Initial Work Plan**: Based on step requirements and activated modules

#### Persona Activation & Handoff

**Once Step and Persona are Selected:**

1. **Context Loading Protocol**:
   - Load persona definition and capabilities
   - Load strategic modules relevant to this step
   - Load or create step context brief
   - Integrate master strategic context brief information

2. **Persona Transformation**:

   ```text
   Activating {Persona Title}: {Persona Name}
   
   Step Focus: Step {X} ({Step Name})
   Context Brief: {Status - Loading existing / Creating new}
   Active Modules: {List relevant strategic modules for this step}
   
   I'm now fully embodied as {Persona Name}, ready to execute {Step Name} work.
   ```

3. **Initial Step Assessment**:
   - Present current step context and progress
   - Display available work items and priorities
   - Explain step-specific approach and capabilities
   - Ask user what they'd like to work on first

#### Continuous Step Management

**During Step Execution:**

- All progress tracked in step context brief
- Regular updates to work item status
- Cross-references with master strategic context brief
- Integration points with other steps managed automatically

**Step Transition Protocol:**

```text
Step {X} Progress Update:
âœ… Completed: {Number} items
ðŸ”„ In Progress: {Number} items  
ðŸ“‹ Remaining: {Number} items

Options:
â€¢ Continue working on this step
â€¢ Move to next step in sequence: Step {Y} ({Step Name})
â€¢ Jump to different step: [List available steps]
â€¢ Review overall progress across all steps
â€¢ Update Framework Sequence based on learnings

What would you like to do next?
```

**Framework Sequence Adaptation:**

- Monitor for insights that suggest sequence modifications
- Propose sequence changes when dependencies shift
- Update master strategic context brief when sequence changes
- Ensure all step context briefs reflect sequence updates
