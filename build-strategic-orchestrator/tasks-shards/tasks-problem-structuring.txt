# Problem Structuring Task

## Purpose

To decompose complex, ambiguous business challenges into solvable components using structured problem-solving methodologies. This task creates clarity from chaos and establishes a systematic approach to addressing strategic challenges.

## Inputs Required

- Problem statement or business challenge description
- Stakeholder perspectives on the problem
- Available context and background information
- Constraints and success criteria

## Task Execution Instructions

### 1. Problem Definition & Scoping

- **Initial Problem Statement:**
  - Capture the problem as initially described
  - Identify who is experiencing the problem
  - Understand why solving this problem matters now
  - Assess urgency and scope of impact

- **Stakeholder Mapping:**
  - Identify all parties affected by or involved in the problem
  - Understand different stakeholder perspectives
  - Map stakeholder influence and interest levels
  - Identify potential resistance or support

### 2. Issue Tree Development

- **Primary Problem Decomposition:**
  - Break the main problem into 3-5 major components
  - Ensure components are MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
  - Use "How might we..." framing for each component
  
- **Secondary Breakdown:**
  - Further decompose each major component into sub-issues
  - Continue until issues become specific and actionable
  - Identify root causes vs. symptoms at each level

### 3. Hypothesis Formation

- **Develop Testable Hypotheses:**
  - For each branch of the issue tree, formulate specific hypotheses
  - State hypotheses in "If... then..." format
  - Ensure hypotheses are testable with available resources
  
- **Prioritize Hypotheses:**
  - Rank by potential impact if proven true
  - Assess ease of testing and validation
  - Identify quick wins vs. long-term investigations

### 4. Root Cause Analysis

- **5-Whys Analysis:**
  - Apply 5-Whys technique to key problem components
  - Trace symptoms back to fundamental causes
  - Identify system-level vs. isolated issues
  
- **Fishbone Diagram:**
  - Categorize potential causes (People, Process, Technology, Environment)
  - Brainstorm all possible contributing factors
  - Identify which causes can be influenced or controlled

### 5. Problem Prioritization Matrix

- **Impact vs. Effort Assessment:**
  - Evaluate each problem component on impact potential
  - Assess difficulty/effort required to address
  - Create 2x2 matrix for prioritization
  
- **Strategic Alignment:**
  - Assess how solving each component advances strategic goals
  - Consider resource availability and organizational capabilities
  - Factor in timing and interdependencies

### 6. Solution Framework Design

- **Intervention Categories:**
  - Quick wins (high impact, low effort)
  - Strategic initiatives (high impact, high effort)
  - Process improvements (moderate impact, low effort)
  - Long-term bets (uncertain impact, high effort)
  
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Define how success will be measured for each problem component
  - Establish baseline metrics where possible
  - Set realistic timelines for improvement

## Output Deliverables

- **Problem Structure Map:** Visual representation of issue tree and root causes
- **Hypothesis Register:** Prioritized list of testable hypotheses
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Detailed investigation of fundamental drivers
- **Solution Framework:** Categorized approach to addressing problem components
- **Action Plan:** Sequenced initiatives with owners and timelines

## Success Criteria

- Complex problem is broken into manageable, specific components
- Root causes are identified and differentiated from symptoms
- Hypotheses are testable and prioritized appropriately
- Solution approach is systematic and resource-appropriate
- Stakeholders have clarity on problem scope and approach
