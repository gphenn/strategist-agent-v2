# Financial Modeling Task

## Purpose

To build comprehensive financial models that support strategic decision-making through quantitative analysis of business performance, investment opportunities, and value creation scenarios. This task creates the numerical foundation for evaluating strategic options and their financial implications.

## Inputs Required

- Business strategy and strategic objectives
- Historical financial data and performance metrics
- Market assumptions and competitive dynamics
- Investment requirements and resource constraints
- Success criteria and performance targets

## Task Execution Instructions

### 1. Model Structure & Design

- **Model Purpose Definition:**
  - Clearly define what decisions the model will support
  - Identify key questions the model must answer
  - Establish required outputs and reporting format
  - Determine model complexity and detail level

- **Model Architecture:**
  - Design modular structure with distinct worksheets/sections
  - Create clear inputs, calculations, and outputs sections
  - Build in scenario and sensitivity analysis capabilities
  - Ensure model is auditable and easy to follow

### 2. Revenue Model Development

- **Revenue Stream Analysis:**
  - Identify all sources of revenue (products, services, subscriptions)
  - Model pricing strategies and revenue recognition
  - Build customer acquisition and retention assumptions
  - Include seasonality and cyclical patterns

- **Customer Economics:**
  - Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV/LTV)
  - Model Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
  - Analyze LTV:CAC ratios and payback periods
  - Include churn rates and expansion revenue

- **Market Penetration Modeling:**
  - Link revenue projections to market sizing analysis
  - Model adoption curves and penetration rates
  - Include competitive response and market share dynamics
  - Build in viral coefficients and network effects where applicable

### 3. Cost Structure Modeling

- **Cost Categories:**
  - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and variable costs
  - Sales and Marketing expenses with scaling factors
  - General and Administrative (G&A) costs
  - Research and Development investments

- **Cost Behavior Analysis:**
  - Identify fixed vs. variable cost components
  - Model economies of scale and learning curves
  - Include step-function costs and capacity constraints
  - Build in inflation and cost escalation factors

### 4. Investment & Capital Requirements

- **Capital Expenditure Planning:**
  - Model required investments in infrastructure, technology, equipment
  - Include timing and phasing of capital deployments
  - Calculate depreciation and asset utilization
  - Plan for maintenance and replacement cycles

- **Working Capital Modeling:**
  - Model accounts receivable, inventory, and payable cycles
  - Calculate working capital requirements and cash conversion
  - Include seasonal working capital fluctuations
  - Plan for growth-related working capital needs

### 5. Financial Statement Integration

- **Profit & Loss Modeling:**
  - Build detailed P&L from revenue and cost models
  - Include all operating expenses and tax calculations
  - Model EBITDA, operating income, and net income
  - Calculate key profitability metrics and ratios

- **Cash Flow Analysis:**
  - Build operating, investing, and financing cash flows
  - Include working capital and capital expenditure impacts
  - Calculate free cash flow and cash burn rates
  - Model funding requirements and cash runway

- **Balance Sheet Projections:**
  - Project assets, liabilities, and equity over time
  - Include debt financing and equity investment scenarios
  - Calculate key financial ratios (leverage, liquidity, efficiency)
  - Ensure balance sheet balances and is internally consistent

### 6. Valuation & Return Analysis

- **Business Valuation:**
  - Calculate Net Present Value (NPV) using appropriate discount rates
  - Build discounted cash flow (DCF) models
  - Include terminal value calculations
  - Perform comparable company and transaction analysis

- **Return Metrics:**
  - Calculate Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
  - Analyze Return on Investment (ROI) and Return on Equity (ROE)
  - Model payback periods and break-even analysis
  - Include risk-adjusted return calculations

### 7. Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis

- **Scenario Planning:**
  - Build best case, base case, and worst case scenarios
  - Model different strategic options and market conditions
  - Include competitive response scenarios
  - Test impact of major assumptions on outcomes

- **Monte Carlo Simulation:**
  - Identify key uncertain variables and their distributions
  - Run multiple iterations to generate outcome distributions
  - Calculate probability of achieving key targets
  - Identify most critical success factors

## Output Deliverables

- **Financial Model:** Comprehensive Excel/spreadsheet model with all calculations
- **Executive Dashboard:** Summary of key metrics and scenario results
- **Valuation Analysis:** Business valuation and investment returns
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Impact of key variables on financial outcomes
- **Scenario Comparison:** Side-by-side comparison of strategic alternatives
- **Model Documentation:** Assumptions, data sources, and methodology explanation

## Success Criteria

- Model accurately reflects business strategy and operations
- Financial projections are realistic and well-supported
- Model is flexible enough to test different scenarios
- Key financial metrics align with industry benchmarks
- Model logic is transparent and auditable
- Outputs directly support strategic decision-making
