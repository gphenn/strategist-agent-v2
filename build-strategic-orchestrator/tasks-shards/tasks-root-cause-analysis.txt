==================== START: root-cause-analysis ====================
# Root Cause Analysis Task

## Purpose

To systematically trace symptoms back to fundamental causes, distinguishing between surface-level issues and underlying systemic problems. This task applies rigorous investigative methodology to identify the true drivers of business challenges, enabling targeted and effective interventions.

## Inputs Required

- Problem statement and observed symptoms
- Stakeholder perspectives on the issue
- Historical data and timeline of problem emergence
- System context and organizational constraints
- Available resources for investigation

## Task Execution Instructions

### 1. Problem Symptom Mapping

- **Document Observable Symptoms:**
  - List all visible manifestations of the problem
  - Quantify impact where possible (costs, delays, quality issues)
  - Map timing and frequency of symptom occurrence
  - Identify patterns in symptom emergence

- **Stakeholder Perspective Gathering:**
  - Interview people closest to the problem
  - Collect different viewpoints on problem causation
  - Identify conflicting explanations and hypotheses
  - Map stakeholder biases and interests

### 2. 5-Whys Deep Dive Analysis

- **Sequential Why Analysis:**
  - Start with primary symptom: "Why does [symptom] occur?"
  - For each answer, ask "Why does that happen?"
  - Continue for at least 5 levels of questioning
  - Document each level with supporting evidence

- **Multiple Path Exploration:**
  - Apply 5-Whys to different symptom manifestations
  - Identify where different paths converge on common causes
  - Explore alternative explanations at each level
  - Test logical consistency of causal chains

### 3. Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram Construction

- **Cause Category Framework:**
  - **People:** Skills, motivation, training, communication
  - **Process:** Procedures, workflows, handoffs, controls
  - **Technology:** Systems, tools, automation, data
  - **Environment:** Culture, structure, resources, external factors
  - **Materials:** Information, inputs, quality, availability
  - **Methods:** Approaches, standards, measurement, decision-making

- **Systematic Cause Brainstorming:**
  - For each category, brainstorm all potential contributing factors
  - Use team workshops to generate comprehensive lists
  - Apply structured techniques like brainwriting and nominal groups
  - Prioritize causes by likelihood and evidence

### 4. Data-Driven Validation

- **Evidence Collection:**
  - Gather quantitative data supporting or refuting potential causes
  - Conduct process observations and measurements
  - Analyze historical trends and correlations
  - Review documentation and system logs

- **Hypothesis Testing:**
  - Formulate testable hypotheses about root causes
  - Design experiments or pilots to test causation
  - Use control groups where possible
  - Apply statistical analysis to validate relationships

### 5. Systems Thinking Analysis

- **Feedback Loop Identification:**
  - Map reinforcing loops that amplify problems
  - Identify balancing loops that maintain status quo
  - Look for delays between causes and effects
  - Understand system structure creating problems

- **Interconnection Mapping:**
  - Identify how different parts of organization interact
  - Map information flows and decision points
  - Understand resource dependencies and constraints
  - Analyze power dynamics and incentive structures

### 6. Root Cause Prioritization

- **Impact Assessment:**
  - Evaluate business impact of each identified root cause
  - Consider both direct and indirect consequences
  - Assess scope of influence across organization
  - Quantify potential value of addressing each cause

- **Controllability Analysis:**
  - Assess organization's ability to influence each root cause
  - Identify causes requiring external partnerships
  - Evaluate resource requirements for intervention
  - Consider timeframe needed for effective action

### 7. Verification & Validation

- **Cross-Validation:**
  - Test root cause conclusions with multiple stakeholders
  - Verify findings against historical precedents
  - Check consistency with organizational knowledge
  - Validate through pilot interventions where possible

- **Alternative Explanation Testing:**
  - Actively seek evidence contradicting conclusions
  - Test competing hypotheses about causation
  - Consider cognitive biases in analysis process
  - Engage devil's advocate perspectives

## Output Deliverables

- **Root Cause Analysis Report:** Comprehensive documentation of investigation process and findings
- **Fishbone Diagram:** Visual representation of all potential contributing factors
- **5-Whys Analysis:** Detailed causal chain documentation for each symptom path
- **Evidence Register:** Compilation of supporting data and validation efforts
- **Root Cause Priority Matrix:** Ranked list of causes by impact and controllability
- **Intervention Recommendations:** Targeted actions to address identified root causes

## Success Criteria

- Root causes are distinguished from symptoms through rigorous analysis
- Multiple investigation methods converge on consistent findings
- Conclusions are supported by verifiable evidence and data
- Identified root causes are specific and actionable
- Analysis reveals systemic issues beyond isolated incidents
- Stakeholders agree with findings and causation logic
- Recommended interventions directly target validated root causes
