# Context Assessment Framework

## Purpose

Simple framework for the Strategic Orchestrator to assess readiness for strategic work without doing analytical work itself.

## Four Readiness Dimensions

### 1. Situation Clarity

**Question:** "Do we understand the business context?"

- **What we need:** Basic understanding of organization, industry, current state
- **NOT analytical depth:** Just enough context for persona selection
- **Readiness indicator:** User can describe their business situation clearly

### 2. Challenge Definition

**Question:** "Do we understand the problem or opportunity?"

- **What we need:** User's perspective on what they're trying to address
- **NOT root cause analysis:** Just their current understanding
- **Readiness indicator:** User can articulate why this matters now

### 3. Stakeholder Understanding

**Question:** "Do we know who's involved and affected?"

- **What we need:** Key players, decision makers, affected groups
- **NOT stakeholder analysis:** Just awareness of who matters
- **Readiness indicator:** User knows who cares about the outcome

### 4. Outcome Expectations

**Question:** "Do we understand what success looks like?"

- **What we need:** User's desired outcomes and constraints
- **NOT success metrics:** Just directional understanding
- **Readiness indicator:** User has vision of desired future state

## Readiness Assessment

### Ready to Proceed When

- [ ] User can describe their business context (doesn't need to be complete)
- [ ] User can explain why this challenge matters (doesn't need to be quantified)
- [ ] User knows who the key stakeholders are (doesn't need full mapping)
- [ ] User has some vision of success (doesn't need precise metrics)

### Keep Exploring When

- User seems unclear about basic business context
- User can't explain why this is important now
- User doesn't know who would be involved or affected
- User has no sense of what they want to achieve

### User Signals to Watch For

- **"I'm not sure..."** - Opportunity for gentle probing
- **"I think that's enough..."** - Respect user's readiness
- **"Let me think about that..."** - Give space, don't push
- **"I want to get started..."** - User is ready to proceed

## Mode-Specific Application

### Express Mode

- Quick check of all four dimensions
- Accept user's initial answers
- Proceed once basic understanding exists

### Deep Discovery Mode

- Thorough exploration of each dimension
- Multiple follow-up questions as needed
- User controls when to transition

## What This Framework Does NOT Do

❌ **Analyze the problem** - That's the Analyst's job  
❌ **Solve anything** - That's the Specialist's job  
❌ **Score complexity** - Just assess readiness  
❌ **Generate insights** - That's the Communicator's job  
❌ **Make decisions** - That's the Advisor's job  

## What This Framework DOES Do

✅ **Helps user clarify their thinking** through good questions  
✅ **Identifies what user knows vs doesn't know**  
✅ **Assesses readiness for productive strategic work**  
✅ **Creates clean handoff** to appropriate persona  
✅ **Respects user's time and preferences**
