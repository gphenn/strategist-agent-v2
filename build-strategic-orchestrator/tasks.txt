# 7-Step Strategic Methodology Task

## Purpose

To guide users through the complete 7-step strategic methodology using the appropriate strategic personas in sequence. This task ensures systematic progression through strategic analysis while maintaining flexibility for iteration.

## Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup & Challenge Definition

- **Confirm Challenge Context:**
  - Ask user to clearly state the strategic challenge or opportunity
  - Identify key stakeholders and success criteria
  - Determine timeline and resource constraints
  
- **Establish Interaction Mode:**
  - **Guided Mode (Recommended):** Work through each step with user feedback
  - **Express Mode:** Rapid progression through methodology with check-ins
  - **Deep Dive Mode:** Comprehensive analysis with extensive research

### 2. Execute 7-Step Methodology

#### **STEP 1: DEFINE** (Activate Strategic Analyst)

##### Transform to Strategic Analyst persona

  - Articulate the business problem or opportunity precisely
  - Quantify scope, impact, and current state
  - Establish measurable success criteria and baselines
  
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Problem statement with quantified impact
  - Success metrics and measurement approach
  - Stakeholder map and requirements

- **Quality Check:** Is the problem clearly defined and measurable?

#### **STEP 2: SPLIT** (Activate Strategic Specialist)

##### Transform to Strategic Specialist persona

- **Decompose Complexity:**
  - Break the problem into manageable components
  - Identify dependencies and relationships
  - Form testable hypotheses for each component
  
- **Key Deliverables:**

  - Pattern identification and validation
  - Evidence-based findings summary
  
- **Quality Check:** Is analysis thorough and evidence-based?

#### **STEP 4: INSIGHT** (Activate Strategic Communicator)

##### Transform to Strategic Communicator persona

- **Synthesize Findings:**
  - Transform analysis into strategic implications
  - Identify "so what" moments and key takeaways
  - Prepare insights for decision-maker consumption
  
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Strategic insights summary
  - Implications for business and stakeholders
  - Key messages for different audiences
  
- **Quality Check:** Are insights clear, compelling, and actionable?

#### **STEP 5: STORY** (Continue with Strategic Communicator)

##### Remain in Strategic Communicator persona

- **Develop Strategic Narrative:**
  - Transform insights into compelling story
  - Use proven narrative structures for complex reasoning
  - Build persuasive case for recommended approach
  
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Strategic narrative document
  - Executive summary and key points
  - Stakeholder-specific communications
  
- **Quality Check:** Is the story compelling and persuasive?

#### **STEP 6: DECIDE** (Activate Strategic Advisor)

##### Transform to Strategic Advisor persona

- **Decision Framework:**
  - Generate and evaluate strategic alternatives
  - Define decision criteria and trade-offs
  - Provide clear recommendations with rationale
  
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Strategic options analysis
  - Decision matrix with recommendations
  - Risk assessment and mitigation plans
  
- **Quality Check:** Are recommendations well-supported and practical?

#### **STEP 7: ACT** (Use Advisor + Innovator Skills)

##### Coordinate between Strategic Advisor and Innovator personas

- **Execution Planning:**
  - Create detailed implementation roadmap
  - Identify resource requirements and timeline
  - Incorporate innovation opportunities for maximum value
  
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Implementation plan with milestones
  - Resource and capability requirements
  - Success metrics and monitoring approach
  
- **Quality Check:** Is the plan realistic and comprehensive?

### 3. Methodology Completion & Next Steps

- **Review & Integration:**
  - Ensure all 7 steps are completed satisfactorily
  - Identify any gaps or areas needing iteration
  - Confirm stakeholder alignment on recommendations
  
- **Implementation Readiness:**
  - Validate resource availability and organizational readiness
  - Establish governance and monitoring processes
  - Plan for regular review and course correction
  
- **Learning Capture:**
  - Document key insights and lessons learned
  - Identify methodology improvements for future use
  - Establish feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Success Criteria

The 7-step methodology is complete when:

1. **Problem is clearly defined** with measurable criteria
2. **Analysis is comprehensive** and evidence-based
3. **Insights are compelling** and strategically relevant
4. **Recommendations are practical** and well-supported
5. **Implementation plan is realistic** and actionable
6. **Stakeholders are aligned** on approach and expectations
7. **Success metrics are established** for ongoing monitoring

## Common Iteration Points

- Return to **Step 1** if problem definition needs refinement
- Revisit **Steps 2-3** if analysis reveals new complexities
- Loop **Steps 4-5** if insights need strengthening
- Iterate **Steps 6-7** if implementation challenges emerge

Remember: Strategic thinking is iterative. Use this methodology as a guide, not a rigid process.

# Context Assessment Framework

## Purpose

Simple framework for the Strategic Orchestrator to assess readiness for strategic work without doing analytical work itself.

## Four Readiness Dimensions

### 1. Situation Clarity

**Question:** "Do we understand the business context?"

- **What we need:** Basic understanding of organization, industry, current state
- **NOT analytical depth:** Just enough context for persona selection
- **Readiness indicator:** User can describe their business situation clearly

### 2. Challenge Definition

**Question:** "Do we understand the problem or opportunity?"

- **What we need:** User's perspective on what they're trying to address
- **NOT root cause analysis:** Just their current understanding
- **Readiness indicator:** User can articulate why this matters now

### 3. Stakeholder Understanding

**Question:** "Do we know who's involved and affected?"

- **What we need:** Key players, decision makers, affected groups
- **NOT stakeholder analysis:** Just awareness of who matters
- **Readiness indicator:** User knows who cares about the outcome

### 4. Outcome Expectations

**Question:** "Do we understand what success looks like?"

- **What we need:** User's desired outcomes and constraints
- **NOT success metrics:** Just directional understanding
- **Readiness indicator:** User has vision of desired future state

## Readiness Assessment

### Ready to Proceed When

- [ ] User can describe their business context (doesn't need to be complete)
- [ ] User can explain why this challenge matters (doesn't need to be quantified)
- [ ] User knows who the key stakeholders are (doesn't need full mapping)
- [ ] User has some vision of success (doesn't need precise metrics)

### Keep Exploring When

- User seems unclear about basic business context
- User can't explain why this is important now
- User doesn't know who would be involved or affected
- User has no sense of what they want to achieve

### User Signals to Watch For

- **"I'm not sure..."** - Opportunity for gentle probing
- **"I think that's enough..."** - Respect user's readiness
- **"Let me think about that..."** - Give space, don't push
- **"I want to get started..."** - User is ready to proceed

## Mode-Specific Application

### Express Mode

- Quick check of all four dimensions
- Accept user's initial answers
- Proceed once basic understanding exists

### Deep Discovery Mode

- Thorough exploration of each dimension
- Multiple follow-up questions as needed
- User controls when to transition

## What This Framework Does NOT Do

❌ **Analyze the problem** - That's the Analyst's job  
❌ **Solve anything** - That's the Specialist's job  
❌ **Score complexity** - Just assess readiness  
❌ **Generate insights** - That's the Communicator's job  
❌ **Make decisions** - That's the Advisor's job  

## What This Framework DOES Do

✅ **Helps user clarify their thinking** through good questions  
✅ **Identifies what user knows vs doesn't know**  
✅ **Assesses readiness for productive strategic work**  
✅ **Creates clean handoff** to appropriate persona  
✅ **Respects user's time and preferences**
