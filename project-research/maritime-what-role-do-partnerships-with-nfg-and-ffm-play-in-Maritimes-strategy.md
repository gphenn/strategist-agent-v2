# What role do partnerships with NFG and FFM play in Maritime’s strategy

**Partnerships with New Found Gold (NFG) and FireFly Metals (FFM) are central to Maritime Resources’ strategy in Baie Verte, providing both financial resources and operational synergies that enhance the company’s growth and flexibility.**

## New Found Gold (NFG)

- **Financial Backing:** NFG became a lead investor in Maritime’s financing rounds, including a US$2 million investment via non-convertible senior secured notes, which helped fund Maritime’s acquisition of the Point Rousse Mining assets, including the Pine Cove mill[1] [2] [3].
- **Toll Milling Agreement:** Maritime and NFG signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) granting NFG exclusivity to negotiate a toll processing agreement at the Pine Cove mill. This arrangement would allow NFG to process ore from its Queensway project at Maritime’s facility, maximizing the use of existing infrastructure and generating processing revenue for Maritime[1] [4] [2] [3].
- **Strategic Infrastructure Use:** The partnership exemplifies Maritime’s vision of leveraging its processing assets for custom mineral processing, supporting both its own projects and those of regional partners, while minimizing environmental impacts by utilizing established facilities[1] [5] [4] [2].

## FireFly Metals (FFM)

- **Equity Investment:** FFM took an 8.4% (non-diluted) equity stake in Maritime, providing additional capital for project development and strengthening Maritime’s balance sheet[6] [7] [8].
- **Port Access Agreement:** FFM secured a long-term agreement to use Maritime’s Pine Cove deepwater port, granting the right to export up to 1 million tonnes of mineral concentrate annually. This provides FFM’s Green Bay Copper-Gold Project with a cost-effective, nearby export route and positions Maritime as a key logistics hub in the district[6] [7].
- **Operational Synergy:** The agreement allows FFM to build storage and handling facilities on Maritime’s property and ensures coordinated use of the port and related infrastructure, enhancing operational efficiency for both companies[6] [7].
- **District Consolidation:** FFM’s investment and collaboration reflect confidence in Maritime’s regional consolidation strategy and support the vision of Baie Verte as a major, multi-commodity mining district[5] [7] [8].

## Strategic Impact

| Partnership | Role in Maritime’s Strategy | Key Benefits |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **NFG**     | Lead investor, toll milling MOU | Capital for acquisitions, processing revenue, infrastructure utilization, industry collaboration |
| **FFM**     | Equity investor, port access partner | Capital injection, logistics revenue, infrastructure sharing, district development synergy |

**In summary, partnerships with NFG and FFM provide Maritime with critical funding, maximize the value of its processing and port assets, and position the company as a central player in the consolidation and development of the Baie Verte mining district**[1] [6] [5] [4] [7] [2] [8] [3].
