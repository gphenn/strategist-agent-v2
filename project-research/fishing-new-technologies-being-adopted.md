# New Technologies and Practices

The local fishing industry on the Baie Verte Peninsula is adopting several **new technologies and practices** aimed at making fishing more eco-friendly and sustainable:

- **LED-Based Bycatch Reduction Systems:** Nets equipped with LED lights have been shown to reduce sea turtle bycatch by up to 60%. This technology helps ensure that non-target species, such as turtles and some fish, are less likely to be caught, supporting both conservation and sustainable fishing[1].

- **Smart Nets and Acoustic Deterrents:** Modern nets now include escape panels, circle hooks, and acoustic devices to prevent entanglement of dolphins, whales, and other non-target species. Modified gillnets and selective gear allow smaller or unintended species to escape, which helps maintain ecosystem balance[1] [4].

- **Precision Fishing Technologies:** Tools like **GPS mapping**, **sonar systems**, and **fish finders** allow fishers to target specific species and locations more accurately. This minimizes the impact on non-target populations and reduces unnecessary bycatch[1] [4] [5].

- **Artificial Intelligence and Real-Time Monitoring:** AI-powered systems can now recognize different fish species as they are caught, providing real-time data on catch composition. This enables fishers and regulators to make timely decisions, optimize quotas, and ensure compliance with sustainability measures[3] [5] [7]. Electronic monitoring systems and cameras on vessels further enhance transparency and data collection[3] [6].

- **Drones and Remote Sensing:** Drones with high-resolution cameras are used to scout fishing areas, monitor fish populations, and observe ocean conditions. Satellite remote-sensing technology provides information on oceanographic conditions, helping fishers plan eco-friendly operations and comply with quotas[4] [6].

- **Eco-Friendly Materials:** The industry is shifting towards **biodegradable fishing lures and baits**, as well as using recycled and sustainable materials in the construction of rods, reels, and other gear. This reduces the environmental footprint of fishing activities[5].

- **Ropeless Fishing Gear:** Innovations such as ropeless traps and pots are being introduced to reduce the risk of entanglement for marine mammals, especially whales[8].

- **Cloud-Based and Traceability Tools:** Technologies now allow tracking of seafood from boat to plate, enhancing traceability and consumer confidence in sustainably sourced products[3].

These advances, combined with ecosystem-based management and community involvement, are helping the Baie Verte Peninsula fishing industry **balance productivity with environmental conservation** and adapt to changing regulations and ecological realities[1] [4] [6].
