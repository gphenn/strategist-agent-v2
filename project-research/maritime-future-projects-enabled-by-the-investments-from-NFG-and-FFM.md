# What future projects could be enabled by the investments from NFG and FFM

**Investments from New Found Gold (NFG) and FireFly Metals (FFM) are enabling Maritime Resources to pursue a range of future projects and strategic initiatives in the Baie Verte district. These investments and partnerships provide capital, operational flexibility, and infrastructure access that open up several key opportunities:**

## 1. Expansion of Custom Mineral Processing

- **Toll Milling for Regional Projects:** The MOU with NFG gives Maritime the opportunity to process ore from NFG’s Queensway project at the Pine Cove mill, potentially generating new revenue streams through toll milling agreements[1] [2]. This sets a precedent for Maritime to become a regional processing hub for other gold and base metal projects in Newfoundland[3].

## 2. Accelerated Development of Hammerdown and Satellite Deposits

- **Faster, Lower-Cost Start-Up:** The acquisition and upgrade of the Pine Cove mill—supported by NFG and FFM investments—allow Maritime to bring the Hammerdown project online more quickly and at a lower capital cost than previously planned[3] [4] [5]. The infrastructure also supports the integration of nearby deposits like Orion and Stoger Tight into future production plans[6].

## 3. Infrastructure-Driven Growth

- **Port and Logistics Expansion:** FFM’s investment and the port access agreement enable Maritime to leverage the Pine Cove deepwater port for the export of mineral concentrates, not only for its own products but also for third parties such as FFM’s Green Bay Copper-Gold Project[7] [8]. This positions Maritime as a critical logistics and export hub for the district, with the potential to handle up to 1 million tonnes of concentrate annually for FFM alone[7] [8].

## 4. District Consolidation and Exploration

- **Acquisition and Exploration of New Properties:** With enhanced financial resources, Maritime can pursue additional property acquisitions and exploration across its 450 km² land package, targeting both gold and base metals[3]. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the resurgence of mining activity in Newfoundland, potentially consolidating further assets and discoveries in the Baie Verte district[3].

## 5. Enhanced Operational Flexibility

- **Multiple Processing Routes:** Ownership of both the Pine Cove and Nugget Pond mills gives Maritime unique flexibility to process a variety of ores and concentrates, including those from third parties, and to optimize logistics and recoveries for its own projects[3] [6].

## 6. Potential for Early Cash Flow and De-Risking

- **Stockpile and Tailings Processing:** The capital infusion allows Maritime to process existing mineralized stockpiles and tailings, generating early cash flow and reducing risk ahead of full-scale mine development[5].

**In summary, investments from NFG and FFM are enabling Maritime Resources to:**

- Fast-track Hammerdown and related projects
- Establish a regional processing and export hub
- Pursue custom milling and concentrate handling for other miners
- Expand exploration and acquisition efforts in the Baie Verte district
- Enhance operational flexibility and reduce startup risk

These initiatives collectively support Maritime’s vision of consolidating and developing Baie Verte into a major, multi-commodity mining district[3] [7] [2].
