# Significance of the Forestry Industry to Baie Verte's Economy

## Economic Role

- **Forestry is a traditional sector** on the Baie Verte Peninsula, providing employment through logging, sawmilling, and related activities. It has historically supplemented the region’s mining and fisheries sectors.
- The industry supports both **commercial operations and domestic harvesting**, with local sawmills and firewood markets serving community and regional needs.
- **Economic diversification:** Forestry helps stabilize the local economy by providing an alternative to mining, which has experienced cycles of boom and decline.

## Relative Contribution

- **Modest share of local GDP:** Compared to mining, the forestry sector’s direct contribution to Baie Verte’s economy is relatively small. Mining remains the dominant industry, but forestry is important for rural employment and community resilience.
- **Employment impact:** Forestry jobs are especially valuable in smaller communities, where they can represent a significant portion of available year-round and seasonal work.
- **Indirect benefits:** The industry supports secondary businesses such as equipment suppliers, transport companies, and local services.

## Provincial Context

- The entire Newfoundland and Labrador forestry sector generates about **$400 million annually** in economic activity, but Baie Verte’s share is only a small fraction of this total. The peninsula is not the province’s largest forestry region, so its revenue and employment impact are limited compared to other areas.
- **Local importance:** Despite its modest scale, forestry remains vital for economic diversification and as a buffer against downturns in other industries.
