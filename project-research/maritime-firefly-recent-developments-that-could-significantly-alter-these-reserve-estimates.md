# Are there any recent developments that could significantly alter these reserve estimates

Yes, there are several **recent developments** that could significantly alter the reserve estimates for both Maritime Resources and FireFly Metals on the Baie Verte peninsula:

- **Aggressive and Successful Drilling Programs:**  
  - **FireFly Metals** has completed extensive drilling at the Ming Mine and the broader Green Bay Copper-Gold Project, with over 79,200 meters drilled by mid-2025 and a total 130,000-meter program underway[1] [2] [3] [4]. This drilling has focused on resource extension, infill, and new discovery targets, with recent results indicating continuous high-grade copper and gold mineralization and the identification of a 700-meter conductive anomaly suggesting substantial untapped potential[2] [4].  
  - **Maritime Resources** has also reported high-grade gold intercepts from grade control and exploration drilling at the Hammerdown Gold Project in 2025, including results such as 49.4 g/t gold over 2.6 meters and 19.9 g/t gold over 17 meters[5] [6]. These results are expected to inform updated resource models.

- **Pending and Upcoming Resource Updates:**  
  - **FireFly Metals** is planning resource estimate updates in the second quarter of 2025, which are likely to incorporate additional high-grade copper and gold from recent drilling and may convert significant portions of Inferred Resources to the higher-confidence Measured and Indicated categories[1] [2] [3] [4].  
  - **Maritime Resources** is preparing an updated technical report in the second half of 2025 to capture recent drilling results and project enhancements at Hammerdown[7].

- **Discovery of New Mineralized Zones and Geophysical Anomalies:**  
  - FireFly’s geophysical surveys (DHEM) have identified new conductive anomalies beyond current drilling, pointing to the potential for additional resource growth at depth and along strike[2] [4].  
  - Both companies continue to test new targets and extensions, with FireFly also drilling at the Rambler Main and East Mines, which remain open and underexplored[4].

- **Resource Conversion and Expansion:**  
  - FireFly’s infill and validation drilling is aimed at upgrading large volumes of Inferred Resources to Measured and Indicated status, which would increase the confidence and potentially the size of the economic resource base[3] [4].  
  - Maritime’s ongoing exploration and near-mine drilling could add new ounces to its reserve base and improve mine planning[7] [6].

**In summary:**

- **Reserve and resource estimates for both companies are expected to increase and/or become more reliable in the near future** due to successful drilling, new discoveries, and upcoming technical updates.
- These developments could significantly alter current valuations, as they may add new resources, upgrade the confidence of existing resources, and extend mine lives[1] [5] [2] [3] [4] [7] [6].

**The most significant factors are the scale and success of 2024–2025 drilling campaigns, new geophysical discoveries, and the imminent release of updated resource estimates by both Maritime and FireFly Metals.**
