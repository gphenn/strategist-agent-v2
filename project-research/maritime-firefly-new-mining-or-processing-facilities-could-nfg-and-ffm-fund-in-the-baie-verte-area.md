# What new mining or processing facilities could NFG and FFM fund in the Baie Verte area

**NFG (New Found Gold) and FFM (FireFly Metals) are positioned to fund and enable several significant new mining and processing facilities in the Baie Verte area, either directly or through their partnerships and investments with Maritime Resources.** The following projects and facilities are either underway, proposed, or strongly enabled by these investments:

## 1. Expansion and Optimization of Processing Facilities

- **Pine Cove Mill Upgrades and Custom Processing**
  - Maritime’s Pine Cove mill, recently acquired and recommissioned, is a fully permitted gold processing facility with a capacity of 1,300–1,400 tonnes per day, a large tailings storage facility, and access to deep-water port infrastructure[1] [2].
  - NFG’s investment and memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Maritime are specifically aimed at enabling toll milling for NFG’s Queensway gold project, which could lead to further upgrades or expansion of the Pine Cove mill to handle additional throughput and different ore types[1] [3] [2].
  - Maritime’s vision includes using Pine Cove as a **regional custom mineral processing hub**, potentially importing and exporting concentrates via the port, and processing both precious and base metal ores for multiple parties[2].

- **Nugget Pond Mill Enhancements**
  - Maritime also owns the Nugget Pond mill (500 tpd), previously used for Hammerdown ore, and plans to pre-concentrate material at Hammerdown before trucking it to Nugget Pond for final processing[2].
  - Future investments could see further upgrades or reconfiguration of Nugget Pond to process additional types of ore, especially as more regional projects come online.

## 2. New Mining Infrastructure and Expansions

- **Green Bay Copper-Gold Project Expansion (FFM)**
  - FireFly Metals is actively expanding its Green Bay project, which includes the Ming underground mine, Little Deer, and the recently acquired Tilt Cove project[4] [5] [6] [7].
  - FFM is proposing a major expansion at Ming’s Bight, with plans for new **underground mining infrastructure, a modern processing plant, tailings management facility, roads, transmission lines, storage, and accommodations**[4] [8].
  - The new processing plant is planned to be right-sized at **1.8 million tonnes per annum**, correcting the previous mismatch between resource size and plant capacity. This facility will be constructed on-site, eliminating the need for long-distance ore transport and optimizing operational efficiency[8].
  - FFM’s investments also support ongoing and future exploration, with a 130,000-meter drilling program and multiple new regional targets being developed[6] [7].

## 3. Port and Logistics Infrastructure

- **Deep-Water Port Facility**
  - Maritime’s acquisition of the Pine Cove port is a key enabler for both NFG and FFM. FFM has secured long-term rights to export up to 1 million tonnes of mineral concentrate per year through this port, and is expected to build storage and handling facilities on-site[2].
  - This infrastructure dramatically reduces logistics costs and opens the door for further export-oriented mining projects in the district.

## 4. District-Scale Exploration and Development

- **New Discoveries and Satellite Deposits**
  - Both FFM and NFG’s investments are supporting aggressive exploration programs, including at the Green Bay project, Little Deer, Tilt Cove, and other VMS and orogenic gold targets identified by FireFly Metals[7].
  - As new discoveries are made, additional satellite mines and processing facilities could be developed, all leveraging the central processing and port infrastructure now controlled by Maritime and its partners.

## Summary Table: Potential New Facilities Enabled by NFG and FFM Investments

| Facility/Project                           | Lead Company      | Type/Function                           | Status/Impact                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Pine Cove Mill Upgrades & Expansion         | Maritime/NFG      | Gold processing, custom toll milling    | Operational, expansion enabled by NFG MOU      |
| Nugget Pond Mill Enhancements               | Maritime          | Gold processing                         | Operational, potential for further upgrades    |
| Green Bay Processing Plant (Ming’s Bight)   | FireFly Metals    | Copper-gold processing (1.8 Mtpa)       | Proposed, enabled by FFM capital               |
| Deep-Water Port Facility                    | Maritime/FFM      | Export of concentrates                  | Operational, expanded use by FFM and others    |
| New Mining Infrastructure (Ming, Little Deer, Tilt Cove) | FireFly Metals | Underground mining, tailings, support facilities | Proposed/expanding, enabled by FFM funding     |

**In conclusion, NFG and FFM’s funding and strategic partnerships are directly enabling the expansion and modernization of mining and processing infrastructure in Baie Verte, including new processing plants, mine expansions, and export logistics, positioning the region as a major hub for gold and copper production in Atlantic Canada**[4] [8] [2].
