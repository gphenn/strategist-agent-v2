# Step 2: Split - Context Brief

**Step:** Step 2 - Split  
**Assigned Persona:** Morgan (Strategic Specialist)  
**Date Created:** January 2025  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Step Overview

**Primary Objective:** Systematically decompose the complex economic development challenge into manageable, structured components that can be analyzed, prioritized, and addressed systematically. Organize the multi-dimensional challenge (stakeholder coordination, infrastructure assessment, service development, workforce planning, funding strategy) into a clear problem structure that enables focused analysis and strategic decision-making.

**Success Criteria:**
- Complex challenge decomposed into clear, manageable components
- Problem structure framework established with defined relationships between components
- Prioritization framework developed for component analysis
- Component boundaries and scope clearly defined
- Structured foundation ready for Step 1 (Define) and Step 3 (Analyse)

**Key Deliverables:**
- Problem decomposition framework
- Component analysis matrix
- Prioritization framework for component work
- Structured problem statement with component relationships
- Component scope definitions and boundaries

**Framework Sequence Position:** Step 2 is positioned first in the framework sequence (Step 2 → Step 1 → Step 3 → Step 4 → Step 5 → Step 6 → Step 7) because the complex multi-stakeholder nature of this project requires systematic problem structuring before detailed market definition and analysis. This foundation enables comprehensive analysis that leads to strategic insights and compelling narratives for stakeholder alignment.

## Strategic Context Integration

**Active Strategic Modules:** Regional Economic Development Strategic Module, Mining Services Economic Development Module

- **Regional Economic Development Strategic Module:** Provides frameworks for stakeholder coordination across multiple government levels, infrastructure planning patterns, and regional economic development best practices. This module's insights will guide the decomposition of stakeholder complexity and infrastructure coordination challenges.

- **Mining Services Economic Development Module:** Offers specialized frameworks for mining service development patterns, workforce capacity building in resource communities, and service contract capture strategies. This module will inform the decomposition of service development and business capacity building components.

**Framework Sequence Rationale:** The complex multi-stakeholder nature of this project requires systematic problem structuring (Step 2) before detailed market definition (Step 1). This foundation enables comprehensive analysis (Step 3) that leads to strategic insights (Step 4) and compelling narratives (Step 5) for stakeholder alignment. The sequence culminates in strategic decisions (Step 6) and implementation planning (Step 7) that address the urgent timeline requirements.

**Dependencies:**

- **Prerequisite Steps:** Discovery phase completed (strategic context brief established)
- **Dependent Steps:** 
  - Step 1 (Define) - Will use the structured problem framework to define market and service opportunities
  - Step 3 (Analyse) - Will analyze each component systematically based on the decomposition structure
  - All subsequent steps depend on having a clear problem structure to guide strategic work

## Work Plan & Action Items

### Approach Strategy

Morgan's systematic problem-solving approach will decompose the economic development challenge into structured components using methodical decomposition techniques. The approach will:

1. **Identify Core Problem Dimensions:** Break down the challenge into major dimensions (stakeholder coordination, infrastructure, service development, workforce, funding, regulatory)

2. **Decompose Each Dimension:** Further break down each dimension into specific components that can be analyzed independently

3. **Establish Relationships:** Map relationships and dependencies between components

4. **Develop Prioritization Framework:** Create criteria for prioritizing component work based on urgency, dependencies, and strategic importance

5. **Define Component Boundaries:** Clearly establish what's in scope and out of scope for each component

6. **Structure for Analysis:** Organize components in a way that enables systematic analysis in Step 3

The Regional Economic Development and Mining Services modules will provide specialized frameworks for stakeholder coordination, infrastructure planning, and service development patterns that enhance the systematic decomposition approach.

### Outgoing Handoff (To Next Persona)

**Next Persona:** Quinn (Strategic Analyst) - Step 1 (Define)

**Context to Transfer:**

**Key Decisions Made:**

- **Decision 1:** Problem decomposed into 6 dimensions with 24 components using MECE principles - **Rationale:** Ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining clear boundaries for analysis - **Implications:** Step 1 (Define) can now work on component-specific problem statements. Step 3 (Analyse) has clear structure for systematic analysis.

- **Decision 2:** Stakeholder coordination established as foundational dimension - **Rationale:** All other dimensions depend on stakeholder alignment - **Implications:** Step 1 should prioritize stakeholder engagement plan. All subsequent work requires stakeholder coordination.

- **Decision 3:** Components prioritized into P1/P2/P3 framework based on urgency, strategic importance, and dependencies - **Rationale:** Timeline pressure requires clear prioritization - **Implications:** Step 1 and Step 3 should focus on P1 components first. P2 and P3 components can be phased.

- **Decision 4:** Component boundaries clearly defined with in-scope and out-of-scope for Step 2 - **Rationale:** Prevents scope creep and ensures clear handoff - **Implications:** Step 1 knows what to define. Step 3 knows what to analyze. Clear boundaries prevent overlap.

**Alternative Approaches Evaluated:**

- **Option A:** {Description} - **Why Rejected:** {Rationale} - **Future Relevance:** {Could this be relevant later?}
- **Option B:** {Description} - **Why Rejected:** {Rationale} - **Future Relevance:** {Could this be relevant later?}

**Critical Insights for Next Steps:**

- **Insight 1:** Problem successfully decomposed into 6 dimensions with clear MECE structure - **Relevance:** Step 1 (Define) should use this structure to create component-specific problem statements. Each dimension can be defined independently while maintaining relationships.

- **Insight 2:** Data availability varies significantly across components - **Relevance:** Step 1 should prioritize defining components with available data (stakeholder coordination, business capacity, risk identification). Components needing data collection (infrastructure, funding sources) should have data collection plans developed.

- **Insight 3:** Stakeholder coordination is foundational and enables all other dimensions - **Relevance:** Step 1 should prioritize stakeholder engagement plan development. This enables all subsequent work and should be completed early.

- **Insight 4:** Work package alignment provides clear implementation path - **Relevance:** Step 1 can align component definitions with work packages. WP1 (stakeholder engagement) and WP4 (business analysis) can proceed immediately. WP3 (infrastructure) and WP8 (financial) need data collection first.

**Recommended Focus Areas:**

- **Primary Focus:** Define market and service opportunities within each component structure. Prioritize P1 components (stakeholder coordination, service opportunity mapping, business capacity assessment, infrastructure capacity assessment, workforce capacity assessment, funding source identification, regulatory assessment, risk identification).

- **Secondary Considerations:** Develop data collection plans for components needing additional data. Create component-specific problem statements aligned with work packages. Establish detailed requirements for each component.

- **Potential Challenges:** Some components need data collection before detailed definition (infrastructure assessments, municipal financial records, funding source research). Balance between defining what's possible now vs. planning for data collection. Ensure component definitions align with work package structure.

**Stakeholder Considerations:**

- **Key Stakeholder Feedback:** High urgency level - need to be ready for Spring-Summer 2026 camp construction. Deep discovery and thorough analysis preferred. Active participation in strategic planning desired.

- **Stakeholder Expectations:** Stakeholders expect comprehensive strategy that addresses all dimensions. Clear problem structure should enable focused analysis and decision-making. Timeline pressure requires efficient, structured approach.

- **Communication Needs:** Problem structure should be validated with key stakeholders before proceeding to Step 1. Stakeholder engagement plan (WP1) should be developed early to enable all other work.
