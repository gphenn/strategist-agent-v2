## Core Problem Statement

**The Town of Baie Verte must develop a comprehensive economic development strategy to capture 80-85% of mining service contracts locally while addressing critical infrastructure needs, workforce capacity building, and funding requirements, all within a Spring-Summer 2026 timeline, while navigating complex stakeholder coordination, regulatory compliance, and resource constraints.**

---

## Problem Structure

The challenge is systematically decomposed into **6 major dimensions** with **24 specific components**, organized using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principles:

### Dimension 1: Stakeholder Coordination & Engagement
**Core Question:** How might we coordinate and align multiple stakeholders across government, business, and community groups to support economic development objectives?

**Components:**
1. Government stakeholder coordination (municipal, provincial, federal)
2. Business stakeholder engagement (Firefly Metals, local businesses, Chamber)
3. Community & Indigenous stakeholder engagement (Qalipu First Nation, workforce, communities)
4. Task Force & implementation team coordination

### Dimension 2: Service Business Development & Market Capture
**Core Question:** How might we develop local business capacity to capture 80-85% of mining service contracts while meeting quality and competitive requirements?

**Components:**
1. Service opportunity identification & mapping
2. Business capacity assessment
3. Business development strategy
4. Service contract capture strategy

### Dimension 3: Infrastructure Assessment & Development
**Core Question:** How might we assess current infrastructure capacity and develop critical infrastructure upgrades to support both town and mine expansion needs?

**Components:**
1. Infrastructure capacity assessment
2. Infrastructure gap analysis
3. Infrastructure development prioritization
4. Infrastructure investment planning

### Dimension 4: Workforce Development & Capacity Building
**Core Question:** How might we develop local workforce capacity to meet service business needs while addressing skills gaps and recruitment challenges?

**Components:**
1. Workforce capacity assessment
2. Skills development & training
3. Recruitment & retention strategy
4. Workforce development partnerships

### Dimension 5: Funding Strategy & Financial Capacity
**Core Question:** How might we secure provincial, federal, and venture capital funding for business development and infrastructure investment while managing municipal financial capacity?

**Components:**
1. Funding source identification
2. Municipal financial capacity assessment
3. Funding strategy development
4. Financial modeling & projections

### Dimension 6: Regulatory Compliance & Risk Management
**Core Question:** How might we navigate regulatory requirements (including Qalipu First Nation consultation) and manage project risks to ensure successful implementation?

**Components:**
1. Regulatory requirements assessment
2. Risk identification & assessment
3. Risk mitigation strategy
4. Monitoring & contingency planning

## Component Relationships

### Critical Dependencies

**Stakeholder Coordination → All Other Dimensions**
- All dimensions require stakeholder alignment and engagement
- Government stakeholders critical for funding and regulatory approval
- Business stakeholders essential for service development
- Community stakeholders necessary for workforce and social license

**Infrastructure Assessment → Service Development**
- Service businesses require adequate infrastructure (power, water, transportation)
- Infrastructure capacity limits service business capacity
- Infrastructure timeline must align with service development timeline

**Workforce Development → Service Development**
- Service businesses require trained workforce
- Workforce capacity limits service business capacity
- Training timeline must align with service business startup timeline

**Funding Strategy → Infrastructure & Service Development**
- Infrastructure development requires significant funding
- Service business development requires startup and expansion funding
- Funding timeline must align with development timelines

**Regulatory Compliance → Infrastructure & Service Development**
- Infrastructure development requires regulatory approval
- Service businesses require certification and compliance
- Regulatory timeline must align with development timeline

### Dependency Flow

## Constraints & Boundaries

### Known Constraints
- **Timeline:** Spring-Summer 2026 deadline for early-phase services
- **Resources:** Limited local workforce, low unemployment, funding requirements
- **Organizational:** Regional independence preferences, community identity
- **Regulatory:** Qalipu First Nation consultation required
- **Infrastructure:** Current infrastructure insufficient
- **Competition:** Trade worker and service worker shortages

### Component Boundaries
- **In Scope:** Problem structuring, component identification, relationship mapping, prioritization
- **Out of Scope:** Detailed analysis, data collection, implementation planning
- **Handoff to Step 1:** Component-specific problem definition and market opportunity identification
- **Handoff to Step 3:** Component-specific analysis and assessment

## Information Gaps

### Critical Gaps (Block Analysis)
- Business mapping: Existing business capacity vs. service requirements
- Infrastructure assessment: Current capacity, health, and upgrade requirements
- Funding sources: Specific provincial, federal, and venture capital opportunities
- Regulatory requirements: Detailed certification and compliance requirements

### Important Gaps (Enable Better Analysis)
- Employment multiplier: Refined multiplier based on actual service opportunities
- Housing demand: Specific housing type distribution and numbers needed
- Revenue projections: Financial models for local business revenue
- Timeline matrix: Detailed service timeline aligned with Firefly requirements

## Next Steps

### For Step 1 (Define)
1. Use component structure to define market opportunities within each dimension
2. Create component-specific problem statements
3. Develop data collection plans aligned with component structure
4. Establish detailed requirements for each component

### For Step 3 (Analyse)
1. Analyze each component systematically using established structure
2. Conduct detailed assessments within component boundaries
3. Validate hypotheses developed during problem structuring
4. Produce comprehensive analysis for each component
