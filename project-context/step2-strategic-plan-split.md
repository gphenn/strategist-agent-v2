# Strategic Plan: Step 2 (Split) - Problem Structuring

## **Morgan (Strategic Specialist)** Activated

**Role:** Methodical problem-solver with systematic rigor. Excels at breaking down complexity and testing strategic hypotheses.

## **Strategic Modules Active:**

- **Regional Economic Development Module** - Multi-stakeholder coordination frameworks
- **Mining Services Economic Development Module** - Service demand lifecycle patterns

---

## **Step 2 (Split) - Problem Structuring Plan**

### **Objective:**

Decompose the complex Baie Verte economic development challenge into manageable, MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) components for systematic analysis.

### **Approach:**

Systematic problem structuring using mining and regional development frameworks to organize stakeholder, infrastructure, and service development challenges.

## **Checklist: Problem Structuring Framework**

### **Phase 1: Problem Decomposition**

- [ ] **Stakeholder Dimension Decomposition**
  - [ ] Government stakeholders (municipal, provincial, federal)
  - [ ] Business stakeholders (Firefly Metals, local service providers)
  - [ ] Community stakeholders (residents, neighboring communities)
  - [ ] Indigenous stakeholders (Qalipu First Nation consultation)

- [ ] **Geographic Dimension Decomposition**
  - [ ] Town of Baie Verte (municipal focus)
  - [ ] Baie Verte Peninsula (21 communities, regional coordination)
  - [ ] Provincial context (Newfoundland & Labrador)
  - [ ] Federal context (Canada-wide programs)

- [ ] **Timeline Dimension Decomposition**
  - [ ] Early-phase services (Spring-Summer 2026, camp construction)
  - [ ] Development phase (Years 1-3, service expansion)
  - [ ] Full operations (Year 5, optimization)
  - [ ] Post-mining sustainability (legacy planning)

- [ ] **Service Development Dimension Decomposition**
  - [ ] Camp construction services (cafeteria, transportation, cleaning, laundry)
  - [ ] Operational services (ongoing camp and mine support)
  - [ ] Support services (administrative, professional, technical)
  - [ ] Infrastructure services (shared municipal and mining infrastructure)

### **Phase 2: MECE Framework Application**

- [ ] **Service Categories (MECE)**
  - [ ] Essential services (must-have for operations)
  - [ ] Growth services (expansion opportunities)
  - [ ] Advanced services (specialized capabilities)
  - [ ] Support services (administrative and technical)

- [ ] **Infrastructure Categories (MECE)**
  - [ ] Transportation infrastructure (highway, roads, airport)
  - [ ] Utility infrastructure (power, water, sewer, communications)
  - [ ] Social infrastructure (healthcare, education, recreation)
  - [ ] Economic infrastructure (business facilities, industrial sites)

- [ ] **Stakeholder Categories (MECE)**
  - [ ] Decision-makers (authority and approval)
  - [ ] Implementation team (execution and delivery)
  - [ ] Affected groups (impact and benefits)
  - [ ] Support organizations (resources and expertise)

- [ ] **Development Phases (MECE)**
  - [ ] Foundation phase (planning and preparation)
  - [ ] Development phase (implementation and expansion)
  - [ ] Optimization phase (efficiency and sustainability)
  - [ ] Legacy phase (post-mining viability)

### **Phase 3: Hypothesis Development**

- [ ] **Service Development Hypotheses**
  - [ ] Existing businesses can expand to meet 80-85% of service requirements
  - [ ] New businesses can be created to fill service gaps
  - [ ] Local workforce can be trained for competitive bidding requirements
  - [ ] Regional collaboration can enhance service capacity while respecting independence

- [ ] **Infrastructure Development Hypotheses**
  - [ ] Government funding can be secured for critical infrastructure upgrades
  - [ ] Infrastructure upgrades can be completed within timeline requirements
  - [ ] Shared infrastructure can optimize costs and benefits
  - [ ] Infrastructure planning can support both immediate and long-term needs

- [ ] **Stakeholder Coordination Hypotheses**
  - [ ] Existing relationships can be leveraged for enhanced collaboration
  - [ ] Indigenous consultation can be integrated into project planning
  - [ ] Regional coordination can be achieved while respecting community independence
  - [ ] Multi-level government coordination can optimize funding and support

- [ ] **Economic Impact Hypotheses**
  - [ ] 1.5-2x employment multiplier can be achieved through service development
  - [ ] Local revenue generation can support sustainable economic development
  - [ ] Economic diversification can reduce mining dependency
  - [ ] Regional economic benefits can extend beyond Baie Verte

### **Phase 4: Component Relationship Mapping**

- [ ] **Service-Infrastructure Relationships**
  - [ ] Service requirements driving infrastructure needs
  - [ ] Infrastructure capacity enabling service development
  - [ ] Shared infrastructure opportunities and constraints
  - [ ] Infrastructure investment priorities and sequencing

- [ ] **Stakeholder-Service Relationships**
  - [ ] Stakeholder roles in service development and delivery
  - [ ] Service requirements influencing stakeholder coordination
  - [ ] Stakeholder capacity and capability for service provision
  - [ ] Stakeholder incentives and motivations for participation

- [ ] **Timeline-Component Relationships**
  - [ ] Critical path analysis for service development
  - [ ] Infrastructure upgrade sequencing and dependencies
  - [ ] Stakeholder engagement timeline and milestones
  - [ ] Economic impact timeline and measurement points

### **Phase 5: Problem Structuring Validation**

- [ ] **MECE Validation**
  - [ ] All components are mutually exclusive (no overlap)
  - [ ] All components are collectively exhaustive (complete coverage)
  - [ ] Components are at appropriate level of detail
  - [ ] Components are actionable and measurable

- [ ] **Framework Integration Validation**
  - [ ] Mining service patterns integrated with regional development frameworks
  - [ ] Stakeholder coordination approaches combined from both modules
  - [ ] Infrastructure planning integrates both regional and mining-specific requirements
  - [ ] Timeline coordination aligns with both service and infrastructure development

- [ ] **Strategic Alignment Validation**
  - [ ] Problem structure supports 80-85% service capture objective
  - [ ] Components align with 1.5-2x employment multiplier target
  - [ ] Structure enables comprehensive infrastructure development
  - [ ] Framework supports stakeholder alignment and coordination

**Ready to begin systematic problem structuring?**

I'll start with Phase 1: Problem Decomposition, focusing on the stakeholder, geographic, timeline, and service development dimensions. This will create the foundation for our MECE framework application and hypothesis development.
