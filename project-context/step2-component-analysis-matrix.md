## Component Boundaries & Scope

### Clear Boundaries Established
- ✅ Each dimension is mutually exclusive
- ✅ Components within dimensions are clearly defined
- ✅ In-scope and out-of-scope clearly identified
- ✅ Handoff to Step 1 and Step 3 defined

### Boundaries Requiring Refinement
- ⚠️ Service development vs. infrastructure development overlap (housing, community services)
- ⚠️ Workforce development vs. service development overlap (business capacity)
- ⚠️ Funding strategy vs. all other dimensions (cross-cutting)

**Resolution Approach:**
- Service development focuses on business capacity and market capture
- Infrastructure development focuses on physical infrastructure
- Workforce development focuses on human capital
- Funding strategy coordinates across all dimensions
