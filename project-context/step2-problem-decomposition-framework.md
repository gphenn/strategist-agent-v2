# Step 2: Problem Decomposition Framework
## Baie Verte Economic Development Project

**Date Created:** January 2025  
**Step:** Step 2 (Split)  
**Persona:** Morgan (Strategic Specialist)  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Executive Summary

This document systematically decomposes the Baie Verte economic development challenge into manageable, structured components using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principles. The decomposition organizes the multi-dimensional challenge into clear problem dimensions that can be analyzed, prioritized, and addressed systematically in subsequent steps.

**Primary Challenge:** Develop a comprehensive economic development plan to capture 80-85% of mining service contracts locally while addressing infrastructure needs, workforce development, and funding requirements within a Spring-Summer 2026 timeline.

---

## Problem Statement

**Core Challenge:** The Town of Baie Verte needs to maximize local economic benefits from Firefly Metals' planned mine expansion (tripling output over 5 years, growing from 100 to 400+ FIFO workers) by developing a comprehensive strategy that addresses service provision, infrastructure development, and workforce capacity building while navigating stakeholder complexity, regulatory requirements, and resource constraints.

**Why This Matters Now:**
- Services must be operational when Firefly needs them (Spring-Summer 2026 start)
- Infrastructure upgrades require significant lead time
- Workforce development needs early investment
- Funding applications require comprehensive planning
- Competitive advantage depends on early preparation

**Success Criteria:**
- 80-85% of mining service contracts captured locally
- 1 Firefly employee = 1.5-2 local jobs (refined multiplier)
- Critical infrastructure upgrades completed
- New businesses created and existing businesses expanded
- Local workforce trained and retained
- Provincial, federal, and venture capital funding secured

---

## Primary Problem Decomposition (MECE Structure)

The challenge is decomposed into **6 major dimensions**, each mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive:

### Dimension 1: Stakeholder Coordination & Engagement
**Question:** How might we coordinate and align multiple stakeholders across government, business, and community groups to support economic development objectives?

### Dimension 2: Service Business Development & Market Capture
**Question:** How might we develop local business capacity to capture 80-85% of mining service contracts while meeting quality and competitive requirements?

### Dimension 3: Infrastructure Assessment & Development
**Question:** How might we assess current infrastructure capacity and develop critical infrastructure upgrades to support both town and mine expansion needs?

### Dimension 4: Workforce Development & Capacity Building
**Question:** How might we develop local workforce capacity to meet service business needs while addressing skills gaps and recruitment challenges?

### Dimension 5: Funding Strategy & Financial Capacity
**Question:** How might we secure provincial, federal, and venture capital funding for business development and infrastructure investment while managing municipal financial capacity?

### Dimension 6: Regulatory Compliance & Risk Management
**Question:** How might we navigate regulatory requirements (including Qalipu First Nation consultation) and manage project risks to ensure successful implementation?
