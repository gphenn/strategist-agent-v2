## **Four Phases Completed:**

1. **Problem Decomposition** - Broke down the complex opportunity into 4 manageable dimensions:
   - Stakeholder relationships (6 key groups)
   - Geographic service capture (50km radius)
   - Timeline optimization (18-month preparation window)
   - Service development (6 core categories)

2. **MECE Framework Application** - Ensured comprehensive coverage:
   - Mutually exclusive categories for clear boundaries
   - Collectively exhaustive coverage of all aspects
   - Systematic organization of components

3. **Hypothesis Development** - Created 4 core strategic hypotheses:
   - Stakeholder alignment with formal coordination
   - 80-85% service capture within geographic scope
   - Early-phase advantages for long-term success
   - Core services with highest economic multiplier

4. **Component Relationship Mapping** - Identified critical interdependencies:
   - Primary critical path from alignment to operations
   - High-leverage components and bottleneck identification
   - Risk propagation paths and mitigation strategies
   - Positive and negative feedback loops

## **Key Strategic Insights:**

- **Leverage Points**: Municipal coordination, provincial engagement, Firefly partnership, infrastructure investment
- **Critical Success Factors**: Infrastructure readiness, workforce development, business support, diversified funding
- **Risk Mitigation**: Parallel development, diversified funding, early regulatory engagement, strategic positioning

## **Ready for Step 3 (Structure)**

The Split step has provided a solid foundation for the Structure step, where we'll integrate all these components into a comprehensive strategic framework with detailed implementation roadmaps.

Would you like me to proceed with **Step 3 (Structure)** to develop the comprehensive strategic framework and implementation plan?
