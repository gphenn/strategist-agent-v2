### 2.2 Projected Demand (Mining Expansion)

#### Population Growth Projections

**Base Assumptions:**
- Current population: 1,311 (2021 Census)
- Firefly Metals expansion: 100 → 400+ FIFO workers
- Local job creation: 600-800 jobs (1.5-2x multiplier)
- Population growth: Proportional to workforce growth

**Projected Population Growth:**

| Year | FIFO Workers | Local Jobs | Total New Workers | Projected Population | Growth |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 2025 (Current) | ~100 | ~150-200 | ~250-300 | ~1,311 | Baseline |
| 2026 | ~160-200 | ~240-400 | ~400-600 | ~1,711-1,911 | +400-600 |
| 2027 | ~240-280 | ~360-560 | ~600-840 | ~1,911-2,151 | +200-240 |
| 2028 | ~320-360 | ~480-720 | ~800-1,080 | ~2,111-2,391 | +200-240 |
| 2029 | ~400+ | ~600-800 | ~1,000-1,200 | ~2,311-2,511 | +200-240 |

**Note:** Population projections assume all new workers require services. Actual service demand will depend on:
- FIFO workers (may have limited local service needs if camp-based)
- Local workers (will require local services)
- Family members (if workers relocate families)
- Service utilization patterns
