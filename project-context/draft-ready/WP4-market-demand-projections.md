# Market Demand Projections
## Baie Verte Economic Development Project

**Project:** Baie Verte Economic Development Plan for Firefly Metals Mining Expansion  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date Created:** January 2025  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** Framework - To be populated with Firefly Metals service budgets  
**Next Review:** After Firefly Metals Direct Engagement

---

## Document Purpose

This document provides a framework for projecting market demand for mining services based on Firefly Metals workforce expansion. Projections will be refined with detailed service requirements and budgets from Firefly Metals engagement.

**Objective:** Project service demand to enable business development planning, capacity building, and investment decisions.

**Target:** 80-85% of mining service contracts captured locally (from strategic context brief)

---

## Projection Methodology

### Base Assumptions

**Workforce Projections:**
- Current: ~100 FIFO workers
- Year 5: 400+ FIFO workers
- Growth period: 5 years
- Growth rate: ~60 workers per year average

**Employment Multiplier:**
- Target: 1 Firefly employee = 1.5-2 local jobs
- To be refined based on actual service opportunities

**Service Capture Target:**
- Target: 80-85% of mining service contracts locally
- Remaining: 15-20% external providers

**Rotation Schedule:**
- 2-week rotation schedules (from strategic context brief)

|------|-------------|--------|-------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 2025 (Current) | ~100 | Baseline | Current operations | ~150 | ~200 |
| 2026 | ~160-200 | +60-100 | Camp construction phase | ~240-300 | ~320-400 |
