# Projected Housing Needs
## Baie Verte Economic Development Project

**Project:** Baie Verte Economic Development Plan for Firefly Metals Mining Expansion  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date Created:** January 2025  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** Framework - To be refined with workforce and housing data  
**Next Review:** After Workforce Housing Needs Assessment

---

## Document Purpose

This document provides a framework for projecting housing needs based on Firefly Metals workforce expansion and associated local job creation. Projections will be refined with detailed workforce data and housing preferences.

**Objective:** Project housing demand to guide housing development planning and investment decisions.

**Target:** Support workforce expansion (100 to 400+ FIFO workers) and local job creation (1.5-2 local jobs per Firefly employee)

---

## Projection Methodology

### Base Assumptions

**Workforce Projections:**
- Current: ~100 FIFO workers
- Year 5: 400+ FIFO workers
- Growth period: 5 years
- Growth rate: ~60 workers per year average

**Employment Multiplier:**
- Target: 1 Firefly employee = 1.5-2 local jobs
- To be refined based on actual service opportunities

**Housing Assumptions:**
- FIFO workers: May be camp-based (minimal local housing) or may relocate families
- Local workers: Will require local housing
- Household size: 1.5 persons per worker (mix of single and family)
- Housing occupancy: 1 worker per unit (single) or family units

---

## Workforce-Based Housing Demand

### 1. FIFO Worker Housing Needs

#### Scenario A: Camp-Based (Minimal Local Housing)

**Assumptions:**
- FIFO workers live in camp during rotation
- Minimal local housing required
- May require short-term rentals for off-rotation periods

**Housing Demand:**
- **Short-term rentals:** [To be determined]
- **Family relocations:** [To be determined]
- **Total FIFO housing:** [To be calculated]

**Status:** ⚠️ Requires Firefly engagement for worker housing preferences

---

#### Scenario B: Family Relocations

**Assumptions:**
- Some FIFO workers relocate families to Baie Verte
- Require permanent family housing
- Household size: 2-4 persons per family

**Housing Demand:**
- **Workers relocating families:** [To be determined]
- **Family housing units needed:** [To be calculated]
- **Total FIFO housing:** [To be calculated]

**Status:** ⚠️ Requires Firefly engagement for worker housing preferences

---

### 2. Local Job Creation Housing Needs

#### Scenario 1: Conservative (1.5x Employment Multiplier)

**Assumptions:**
- Local jobs: 600 (1.5x multiplier)
- Household size: 1.5 persons per worker
- Housing units: 1 worker per unit (single) or family units

**Housing Demand Projections:**

| Year | FIFO Workers | Local Jobs | Local Workers | Housing Units Needed | Cumulative Need |
|------|-------------|------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 2025 | ~100 | ~150 | ~150 | ~100 | ~100 |
| 2026 | ~160-200 | ~240-300 | ~240-300 | ~160-200 | ~160-200 |

#### Scenario 2: Optimistic (2x Employment Multiplier)

**Assumptions:**
- Local jobs: 800 (2x multiplier)
- Household size: 1.5 persons per worker
- Housing units: 1 worker per unit (single) or family units

**Housing Demand Projections:**

| Year | FIFO Workers | Local Jobs | Local Workers | Housing Units Needed | Cumulative Need |
|------|-------------|------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 2025 | ~100 | ~200 | ~200 | ~133 | ~133 |
| 2026 | ~160-200 | ~320-400 | ~320-400 | ~213-267 | ~213-267 |
| 2027 | ~240-280 | ~480-560 | ~480-560 | ~320-373 | ~320-373 |
| 2028 | ~320-360 | ~640-720 | ~640-720 | ~427-480 | ~427-480 |
| 2029 | ~400+ | ~800+ | ~800+ | ~533+ | ~533+ |

**Total Housing Need (Year 5):** ~533 units

---

### 3. Combined Housing Demand

#### Total Housing Need

**Combining FIFO and Local Worker Needs:**

| Scenario | FIFO Housing | Local Worker Housing | Total Housing Need |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Conservative (1.5x)** | [To be determined] | ~400 units | [To be calculated] |
| **Optimistic (2x)** | [To be determined] | ~533 units | [To be calculated] |

**Status:** ⚠️ Requires FIFO worker housing preferences

---

## Housing Type Distribution

### Projected Housing Type Needs

#### Based on Workforce Composition

**Assumptions:**
- **Single workers:** May prefer apartments, row houses, or small single-detached
- **Families:** May prefer single-detached or larger units
- **Short-term rentals:** May prefer apartments or furnished units

**Projected Distribution (400 units - Conservative):**

| Housing Type | Percentage | Units Needed |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **Single-detached** | 50-60% | 200-240 |
| **Row houses** | 20-30% | 80-120 |
| **Apartments** | 20-30% | 80-120 |
| **Total** | 100% | 400 |

**Projected Distribution (533 units - Optimistic):**

| Housing Type | Percentage | Units Needed |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **Single-detached** | 50-60% | 267-320 |
| **Row houses** | 20-30% | 107-160 |
| **Apartments** | 20-30% | 107-160 |
| **Total** | 100% | 533 |

**Status:** ⚠️ Requires validation from workforce demographics and preferences
