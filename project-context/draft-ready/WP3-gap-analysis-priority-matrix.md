## Document Purpose

This document provides a framework for analyzing infrastructure capacity gaps and prioritizing infrastructure development requirements. The analysis will be completed after comprehensive infrastructure capacity assessment data is collected.

**Objective:** Identify infrastructure capacity gaps, prioritize development requirements, and guide infrastructure investment decisions.

## Gap Analysis Framework

### Gap Analysis Methodology

**Step 1: Current Capacity Assessment**
- Document current infrastructure capacity
- Assess current infrastructure condition
- Calculate current utilization rates
- Identify reserve capacity

**Step 2: Required Capacity Assessment**
- Determine town expansion requirements
- Integrate Firefly Metals infrastructure requirements (from WP2)
- Calculate total required capacity
- Account for growth projections

**Step 3: Gap Calculation**
- Compare current capacity with required capacity
- Calculate capacity gaps
- Identify critical gaps
- Assess gap severity

**Step 4: Gap Prioritization**
- Assess urgency (timeline requirements)
- Assess impact (strategic importance)
- Assess dependencies (enabling other development)
- Assess risk (consequences of inaction)
