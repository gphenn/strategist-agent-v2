## Data Resolution

agent-root: (project-root)/strategist-agent-V2
checklists: (agent-root)/checklists
data: (agent-root)/data
personas: (agent-root)/personas
tasks: (agent-root)/tasks

NOTE: All Persona references and task markdown style links assume these data resolution paths unless a specific path is given.
Example: If above cfg has `agent-root: root/strategist/` and `tasks: (agent-root)/tasks`, then below [Market Analysis](market-analysis.md) would resolve to `root/strategist/tasks/market-analysis.md`
