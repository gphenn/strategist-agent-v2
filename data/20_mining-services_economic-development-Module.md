## Decision Logic & Integration

### Module Activation Logic

```text
PRIMARY_ACTIVATION:
  IF (mining_project_present OR resource_extraction_activity)
  AND (community_development OR service_strategy OR economic_planning)
  AND (geographic_proximity <= 200km OR workforce_accommodation_needed)
  THEN activate_module(priority=high, mode=primary)

SECONDARY_ACTIVATION:
  IF (resource_dependent_economy OR commodity_dependent_community)
  OR (remote_location_development OR infrastructure_sharing_opportunity)
  OR (boom_bust_cycle_management OR mine_closure_planning)
  THEN activate_module(priority=medium, mode=supporting)

COMBINATION_RULES:
  WITH regional_development_module:
    - IF broader_economic_development THEN combine(mode=parallel, lead=regional)
  WITH crisis_management_module:
    - IF mine_closure_crisis THEN sequence(crisis_first)
  WITH technology_module:
    - IF digital_infrastructure_development THEN combine(mode=supporting)
  WITH manufacturing_module:
    - IF value_added_processing THEN sequence(mining_context_first)
```

### Progressive Specialization Strategy

1. **Initial Assessment**: Mining project identification, community impact scope, development opportunity assessment
2. **Specialization Trigger Points**:
   - Major mining project development (high specialization)

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Strategic Orchestrator

- **Loading Priority**: High priority for clear mining/resource contexts, medium for resource-dependent communities
- **Memory Management**: Cache mining project templates, lazy load specialized assessment tools
- **User Interface**: Present mining-specific options prominently when geographic and industry context detected

### For Strategic Personas

- **Persona Adaptation**: Each persona emphasizes mining industry requirements while maintaining core strategic methodology
- **Task Customization**: Mining project lifecycle alignment, community development focus, infrastructure coordination, community engagement specializations
- **Template Modifications**: Mining service business models, economic impact assessments, community development plans, mining community templates for economic development plans, infrastructure strategies, stakeholder engagement
