# Checklist Strategy & Development Roadmap

## Current State

**Existing Checklists:**
- `checklists/strategic-discovery-checklist.md` - Readiness validation for discovery-to-strategy transition

## Strategic Vision for Checklists

Checklists serve as **quality gates** and **completeness validators** at critical moments in the strategic workflow. They ensure:

1. **Work quality** - Completeness of analysis and thinking
2. **Readiness for transition** - Sufficient progress before moving to next phase
3. **Consistency** - Standardized quality across different strategic engagements
4. **Agent accountability** - Clear criteria for what "done" means

## Checklist Types & When They Apply

### 1. **Readiness Checklists** (Transition Gates)
Validate readiness to move from one phase to the next
- **When used:** End of phase, before handoff to next persona
- **Purpose:** Ensure sufficient progress before escalation
- **Example:** "Ready to move from DEFINE to SPLIT?"

### 2. **Completion Checklists** (Phase Deliverables)
Validate that a phase's core work is complete
- **When used:** Within a phase, confirming deliverables are done
- **Purpose:** Ensure all required outputs have been produced
- **Example:** "Have we completed all ANALYSE phase analysis?"

### 3. **Quality Checklists** (Work Validation)
Validate that work meets quality standards
- **When used:** Before finalizing outputs within a phase
- **Purpose:** Ensure rigor and completeness of analysis
- **Example:** "Is our competitive analysis sufficiently detailed?"

### 4. **Template-Specific Checklists** (Document Validation)
Validate that populated templates meet requirements
- **When used:** After completing a template
- **Purpose:** Ensure all sections are filled with sufficient depth
- **Example:** "Is the Strategic Brief complete and ready for presentation?"

### 5. **Decision Point Checklists** (Critical Junctures)
Validate readiness for major decisions
- **When used:** Before finalizing strategic choices
- **Purpose:** Ensure decisions are well-founded
- **Example:** "Are we ready to commit to this strategic option?"

## Checklist Design Principles

### 1. **Action-Oriented**
- Use active verbs: "Have we...", "Is the...", "Have you..."
- Each item should be testable and observable
- Avoid vague criteria

### 2. **Graduated Complexity**
- Basic tier: Foundational requirements
- Advanced tier: Depth and rigor requirements
- Expert tier: Excellence and innovation standards

### 3. **Linked & Referenced**
- Each checklist should reference the relevant task, template, or framework
- Create clear connections to strategic methodology phases
- Document what "done" means in context

### 4. **Honest About Minimums**
- What's truly required (blocking)
- What's nice to have (enhancing)
- What can be added later (deferrable)

### 5. **User-Centric**
- Written for both agents and humans
- Include rationale for each item
- Explain consequences of gaps

## Implementation Priority

### Priority 1 (MVP): Phase Completion Checklists
- Establish clear phase gates
- Enable confident persona handoffs
- Support quality assurance

### Priority 2: Template Validation Checklists
- Ensure populated documents are complete
- Support document quality
- Enable consistent outputs

### Priority 3: Task-Specific Checklists
- Ensure rigor in specific analyses
- Support work quality
- Enable continuous improvement

## Checklist Maintenance

### When to Update Checklists
1. After completing strategic engagements - validate checklist effectiveness
2. When adding new templates - create associated validation checklist
3. When refining tasks - update associated quality checklist
4. When processes change - update phase completion checklists

### Feedback Loop
- Track which checklist items are most frequently "not met"
- Identify patterns where checklists fail to catch issues
- Refine criteria based on real-world usage
- Share learnings across different strategic engagements

## Success Metrics

A successful checklist system will:

1. **Reduce rework** - Catch issues before handing off
2. **Improve consistency** - Similar quality across engagements
3. **Accelerate handoffs** - Clear transition criteria
4. **Build confidence** - Structured validation reduces uncertainty
5. **Enable learning** - Track patterns and improve processes

## Questions for Refinement

1. Should checklists be mandatory blocking gates or advisory guidance?
2. What's the minimum viable checklist for each phase?
3. How do we balance thoroughness with efficiency?
4. Should checklists adapt based on engagement complexity level?
5. How frequently should checklists be revisited and refined?
