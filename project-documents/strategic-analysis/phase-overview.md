# Phase Overview

## Phase 1: phase-1-assessment

The `phase-1-assessment` directory outlines the foundational "Foundation & Assessment" phase of the project. Its primary purpose is to **establish a rigorous quantitative baseline** to inform all subsequent strategic decisions.

Instead of guessing, this phase effectively says: "Before we build anything, let's get the hard numbers."

### Core Objectives

1.  **Establish Quantitative Baseline:** Get firm data on population, infrastructure capacity, and current service levels.
2.  **Validate Assumptions:** Confirm critical hypotheses (e.g., "Can local business really capture 85% of spend?") with evidence.
3.  **Identify Opportunities:** Pinpoint exact gaps between what the mine needs and what the town currently provides.

### Key Work Packages (The "Assessment Engine")

The work plan breaks this down into 10 specific work packages (WPs) to ensure nothing is missed:

*   **WP2: Mining Engagement:** Validating the exact demand (workforce size, service specs).
*   **WP3: Infrastructure Assessment:** Auditing water, sewer, and road capacity for the expansion.
*   **WP4: Business Opportunity Analysis:** Analyzing the gap between local supply and mining demand.
*   **WP5 & WP6:** Assessing **Housing** and **Workforce** capacity to support the influx.
*   **WP8: Financial Capacity:** Determining the town's ability to fund necessary upgrades.

### Why This Matters for Quinn (Strategic Analyst)

For my persona, this directory is the **source of truth**.

*   `01-data-requirements-checklist.md`: The data "shopping list" I need to fill.
*   `03-detailed-work-plan.md`: The battle plan for how we get that data.

## Phase 2: phase-2-split

The `phase-2-split` directory represents the **Problem Structuring** phase. Its purpose is to deconstruct the complex economic development challenge into manageable, distinct components using a systematic approach.

This phase effectively says: "This problem is too big to solve all at once. Let's break it down into pieces we can handle."

### Core Concepts

1.  **Decomposition:** Breaking the problem across 4 key dimensions:
    *   **Stakeholder:** Government, Business, Community, Indigenous.
    *   **Geographic:** Town vs. Peninsula vs. Province.
    *   **Timeline:** Early Phase -> Development -> Operations -> Legacy.
    *   **Service:** Essential -> Growth -> Advanced -> Support.

2.  **MECE Framework:** Ensuring the breakdown is **M**utually **E**xclusive and **C**ollectively **E**xhaustive (no gaps, no overlaps).

3.  **Hypothesis Development:** Creating testable statements (e.g., "H2: Geographic Service Capture: 80-85% capture achievable within 50km radius") to guide the analysis.

### Key Artifacts

*   `01-problem-decomposition-02-mece-framework.md`: The detailed breakdown of all components.
*   `03-hypothesis-development.md`: The specific hypotheses we need to test with data in Phase 3.
*   `split-step-summary.md`: Morgan's executive summary of the structuring work.

### Why This Matters for Quinn

This directory provides the **structure for my analysis**.

*   I don't just "analyze data"; I test the specific **hypotheses** generated here.
*   The **MECE categories** define the buckets I need to fill with numbers in Phase 3.

## Phase 3: phase-3-structure

The `phase-3-structure` directory represents the **Strategic Framework Development** phase. Its purpose is to integrate the analyzed components into a cohesive strategy with clear vision, mission, and implementation pillars.

This phase effectively says: "Now that we have the data (Phase 1) and the structure (Phase 2), let's build the plan."

### Core Deliverables

1.  **Strategic Framework Document:** Establishes the Vision (Mining services hub), Mission, and 4 Strategic Pillars (Stakeholder, Infrastructure, Workforce, Business).
2.  **Implementation Roadmap:** Defines 4 phases of execution (Foundation, Development, Launch, Optimization) with specific actions.
3.  **Resource Allocation:** details the $15-20M investment strategy across infrastructure (60%), business support (25%), and workforce (15%).

### Key Artifacts

*   `structure-step-summary.md`: The comprehensive strategic framework summary.
*   `01-strategic-framework.md`: The detailed strategy document.
*   `02-implementation-roadmap.md`: The high-level timeline and phases.

### Why This Matters

This is where the **strategy** lives. It transforms "analysis" into "direction," defining *what* we are going to do and *where* we are going.

## Phase 4: phase-4-solve

The `phase-4-solve` directory represents the **Execution & Implementation** phase. Its purpose is to turn the strategic plan into action through detailed execution strategies, stakeholder mobilization, and performance monitoring.

This phase effectively says: "We have the plan. Here is exactly HOW we execute it, week by week."

### Core Components

1.  **Execution Strategy:** Detailed action plans for Q1 2026 through 2027.
2.  **Stakeholder Mobilization:** A specific 8-week activation schedule to get all 6 stakeholder groups moving.
3.  **Performance Monitoring:** The dashboard for tracking success (e.g., "Are we hitting the 80% capture target?").

### Key Artifacts

*   `solve-step-summary.md`: The execution playbook summary.
*   `01-execution-strategy.md`: The detailed step-by-step execution guide.
*   `03-performance-monitoring-optimization.md`: The metrics and KPIs for success.

### Why This Matters

This is the **manual for the Project Manager**. It moves from "strategic pillars" to "Monday morning tasks," ensuring the strategy actually gets built.
