# Split Step Summary

**Strategic Specialist (Morgan) - Complete Problem Structuring Analysis**

## Executive Summary

The Split step has systematically deconstructed the Baie Verte mining expansion opportunity into manageable components, identified critical relationships, and developed strategic hypotheses to guide the economic development strategy.

## Key Findings

### Problem Decomposition (Phase 1)

**Four Primary Dimensions Identified**:

1. **Stakeholder Dimension**: 6 key stakeholder groups with varying influence and interests
2. **Geographic Dimension**: 50km service capture radius with regional competition considerations
3. **Timeline Dimension**: 18-month preparation window with critical milestones
4. **Service Development Dimension**: 6 core service categories with different entry barriers

### MECE Framework Application (Phase 2)

**Mutually Exclusive Categories**:

- **Stakeholder Groups**: Firefly Metals, Municipal Government, Provincial Agencies, Federal Agencies, Indigenous Groups, Regional Communities
- **Service Categories**: Food Services, Transportation Services, Laundry Services, Cleaning Services, Technical Services, Support Services
- **Timeline Phases**: Q1 2025 (Alignment), Q2 2025 (Planning), Q3 2025 (Development), Q4 2025 (Implementation), Q1 2026 (Launch), Q2 2026 (Operations)

**Collectively Exhaustive Coverage**:

- All stakeholder relationships mapped and analyzed
- Complete service development spectrum covered
- Full timeline from preparation to operations included
- Geographic scope from local to regional considered

### Strategic Hypotheses (Phase 3)

**Four Core Hypotheses Developed**:

1. **H1: Stakeholder Alignment**: Strong alignment exists but requires formal coordination
2. **H2: Geographic Service Capture**: 80-85% capture achievable within 50km radius
3. **H3: Timeline Optimization**: Early-phase capture creates competitive advantages
4. **H4: Service Development**: Core services provide highest multiplier and lowest barriers

**Critical Success Factors Identified**:

- Infrastructure readiness by Q2 2026
- Workforce development starting Q3 2025
- Business development support implementation
- Diversified funding strategy

### Component Relationships (Phase 4)

**Critical Path Analysis**:

- Primary path: Stakeholder Alignment → Infrastructure Planning → Workforce Development → Business Development → Early Service Capture → Full Operations
- Secondary paths: Infrastructure Development, Business Development, Workforce Development

**Leverage Points Identified**:

- Municipal Government Coordination (central role)
- Provincial Agency Engagement (funding and support)
- Firefly Metals Partnership (primary customer)
- Infrastructure Investment (foundation)

**Risk Propagation Paths**:

- Infrastructure delays → Service delivery delays → Contract loss
- Workforce shortages → Quality issues → Performance problems
- Funding uncertainty → Investment delays → Capacity limitations

## Strategic Insights

### High-Impact Opportunities

1. **Early-Phase Service Capture**: Camp construction services provide entry point for operational contracts
2. **Coordinated Infrastructure Investment**: Enables all service delivery and economic development
3. **Comprehensive Workforce Development**: Creates competitive advantages and addresses capacity constraints
4. **Strategic Stakeholder Alignment**: Maximizes local economic capture through coordinated effort

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Infrastructure Readiness**: Highway upgrades, cell coverage, healthcare capacity, power/water expansion
2. **Workforce Development**: Training programs, certification, recruitment, retention strategies
3. **Business Development Support**: Financial support, technical assistance, procurement navigation
4. **Funding Strategy**: Diversified sources, staged approach, risk mitigation

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Parallel Development Tracks**: Infrastructure and business development simultaneously
2. **Diversified Funding Sources**: Provincial, federal, private sector, municipal
3. **Early Regulatory Engagement**: Compliance planning and approval processes
4. **Strategic Positioning**: Quality advantages and local knowledge

## Validation Framework

### Primary Metrics
