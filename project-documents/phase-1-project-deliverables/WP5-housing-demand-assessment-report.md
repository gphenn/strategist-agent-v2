## Executive Summary

### Assessment Overview

**Assessment Purpose:** Evaluate current housing capacity and project future housing demand to support Firefly Metals mining expansion and associated economic development in Baie Verte.

**Assessment Scope:** Comprehensive assessment of current housing stock, market conditions, and projected housing needs based on workforce expansion (100 to 400+ FIFO workers) and associated local job creation (1.5-2 local jobs per Firefly employee).

**Key Findings:**
- Current population: 1,311 (2021 Census)
- Current housing stock: 647 total private dwellings, 556 occupied dwellings
- Housing types: Primarily single-detached (465 units), with some row houses (45) and apartments (45)
- Average household size: 2.3 persons (2016 data)
- Projected housing demand: [To be calculated based on workforce expansion and local job creation]
- Housing gap: [To be calculated after current housing stock assessment]

**Critical Housing Gaps:**
- Current housing stock assessment required to determine availability
- Housing type distribution needs validation
- Rental market assessment required
- Housing affordability analysis needed

**Priority Recommendations:**
1. Complete current housing stock inventory
2. Assess rental market capacity
3. Project housing demand based on workforce expansion
4. Identify housing development requirements
5. Develop housing investment strategy

- Employment multiplier: 1 Firefly employee = 1.5-2 local jobs (to be refined)
- Local job creation: [To be calculated]

**Projected Population Growth:**

| Year | FIFO Workers | Local Jobs (1.5x) | Local Jobs (2x) | Total New Workers | Projected Population | Growth |
|------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 2025 (Current) | ~100 | ~150 | ~200 | ~250-300 | ~1,311 | Baseline |
| 2026 | ~160-200 | ~240-300 | ~320-400 | ~400-600 | ~1,711-1,911 | +400-600 |
| 2027 | ~240-280 | ~360-420 | ~480-560 | ~600-840 | ~1,911-2,151 | +200-240 |
| 2028 | ~320-360 | ~480-540 | ~640-720 | ~800-1,080 | ~2,111-2,391 | +200-240 |
| 2029 | ~400+ | ~600+ | ~800+ | ~1,000-1,200 | ~2,311-2,511 | +200-240 |

**Note:** Population projections assume all new workers require housing. Actual housing demand will depend on:
- FIFO workers (may not require local housing if camp-based)
- Local workers (will require local housing)
- Household composition (single vs. family)
- Existing housing availability
