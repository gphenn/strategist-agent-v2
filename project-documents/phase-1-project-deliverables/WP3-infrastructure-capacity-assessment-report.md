## Executive Summary

### Assessment Overview

**Assessment Purpose:** Evaluate current infrastructure capacity in Baie Verte to support both town growth and Firefly Metals mining expansion, identify capacity gaps, and prioritize infrastructure development requirements.

**Assessment Scope:** Comprehensive assessment of all critical infrastructure systems including transportation, power, water/sewer, healthcare, telecommunications, and municipal services.

**Key Findings:**
- Infrastructure needs identified: highway, power, healthcare, water/sewer, roads (from strategic context brief)
- Current infrastructure insufficient for town + mine expansion (from strategic context brief)
- Priority infrastructure upgrades identified: Highway Safety, Communications, Healthcare, Energy, Municipal Services (from strategic discovery)
- Critical timeline: Services must be operational when Firefly needs them (Spring-Summer 2026 start)

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- Infrastructure capacity assessment requires municipal data collection
- Current capacity, health, and upgrade requirements are information gaps
- Infrastructure upgrades must align with Spring-Summer 2026 timeline
- Significant infrastructure investment required

**Recommendations:**
1. Conduct comprehensive municipal infrastructure assessment
2. Prioritize infrastructure upgrades based on timeline and strategic importance
3. Develop infrastructure development plan aligned with mining expansion timeline
4. Secure funding for infrastructure investments
5. Coordinate infrastructure development with service development timeline
