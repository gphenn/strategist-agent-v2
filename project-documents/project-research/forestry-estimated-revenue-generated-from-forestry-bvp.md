# Estimated Forestry Revenue on the Baie Verte Peninsula

## Provincial Context

The forestry industry in Newfoundland and Labrador generates approximately **$400 million annually** in economic activity. This figure includes all forest-related sectors such as pulp and paper, sawmilling, value-added manufacturing, and wood energy. The industry is a significant contributor to the provincial economy, especially in rural regions like the Baie Verte Peninsula[1] [2] [3].

## Baie Verte Peninsula Estimate

There are **no official, publicly available figures** that isolate the exact revenue generated solely from forestry activities on the Baie Verte Peninsula. However, several key points provide context:

- The Baie Verte Peninsula is part of Forest Management Zone 7, which is one of several zones contributing to the provincial forestry sector[4].
- The region is home to active sawmills and supports both commercial and domestic harvesting, but it is not the largest forestry zone in the province.
- The peninsula’s forestry sector is considered modest compared to mining and other industries in the area, and its contribution is a small fraction of the provincial total[5] [6].

## Regional Revenue Estimate

While a precise dollar value for the Baie Verte Peninsula is not published, the following **provincial and regional data** can be used to infer a rough scale:

| Area/Level                      | Estimated Annual Forestry Revenue      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Newfoundland & Labrador (total)  | ~$400 million[1] [2] [3]               |
| Baie Verte Peninsula (inferred)  | Likely a small share of provincial total; specific figures not published |

- Given the peninsula’s size and the scale of its forestry operations, it is reasonable to conclude that its direct forestry revenue is **significantly less** than the provincial figure, likely in the **low millions annually**. However, this is only an inference based on the relative size and activity of the region within the province[5] [6].

## Key Takeaways

- **No official, standalone revenue figure** for Baie Verte Peninsula forestry is available.
- The region contributes a modest but important share to the province’s $400 million forestry economy[1] [2] [3].
- Most forestry revenue in the province is generated by larger operations and mills elsewhere, with Baie Verte’s share reflecting its smaller scale and focus on local sawmilling and domestic harvesting.

For the most accurate and up-to-date figures, direct inquiries to the provincial Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture or local forestry management offices are recommended.
