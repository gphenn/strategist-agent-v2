# How has Shoreline's production volume changed yearly

Public data gives only snapshots, not a full year‑by‑year series, but it shows Shoreline starting very high and then operating at roughly 1 million tonnes per year recently.[^1][^2][^3]

## Known production figures

- First 12 months (2016–2017): Shoreline reports crushing and shipping over 2.8 million tonnes of base rock aggregate from Port Rousse to Charleston, South Carolina.[^4][^1]
- Recent year (LinkedIn update): A company update states that in a recent operating year they “crushed, washed, and loaded 904,638 metric tonnes” of aggregate onto 17 ships at Port Rousse.[^2]


## Trend interpretation

- The first‑year 2.8‑million‑tonne figure was tied to a specific large export contract and significant one‑time ramp‑up, so it is higher than later disclosed annual volumes.[^1][^4]
- Later public numbers around 0.9 million tonnes per year suggest a more steady, ongoing production level; there is no published continuous annual series, so anything beyond these two reference points would be speculative.[^3][^2][^1]
