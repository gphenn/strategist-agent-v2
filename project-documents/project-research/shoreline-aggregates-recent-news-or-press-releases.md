## Sustainability and innovation projects

- The Mining Innovation Commercialization Accelerator (MICA) Network recently backed a Shoreline project to convert fine aggregate by‑products into agricultural rock dust, targeting 40,000–45,000 tonnes per year and potential sequestration of up to about 13,500 tonnes of CO₂ annually.[^2]
