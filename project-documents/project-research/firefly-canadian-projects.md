# Firefly Canadian Projects

## Firefly Metals has two major mining projects in Canada

- **Green Bay Copper-Gold Project (Newfoundland & Labrador):**
  This is Firefly’s flagship asset, located in the Baie Verte district. It includes the high-grade Ming underground mine, the Little Deer exploration project, and supporting infrastructure like the Nugget Pond processing facility and Goodyear’s Cove port. The Green Bay project is focused on copper and gold, with a large and growing resource base and ongoing aggressive exploration and expansion[1] [2] [5] [6] [7].

- **Pickle Crow Gold Project (Ontario):**
  Firefly holds a 70% interest in the high-grade Pickle Crow Gold Project in Ontario. This project features an inferred resource of 11.9 million tonnes at 7.2 grams per tonne for 2.8 million ounces of gold, with substantial exploration potential across a 500 km² tenement package. Pickle Crow is recognized as one of Canada’s most prolific historic gold camps and remains a key growth asset for the company[1] [2] [7].

Firefly also has international interests, such as the Limestone Well Vanadium-Titanium Project in Western Australia, but in Canada, its core focus is on Green Bay (Newfoundland) and Pickle Crow (Ontario) [1] [7].
