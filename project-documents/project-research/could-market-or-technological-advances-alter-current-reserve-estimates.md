# Could market or technological advances alter current reserve estimates

Yes, both **market** and **technological advances** can significantly alter current reserve estimates for gold and copper on the Baie Verte peninsula:

## Market Advances

- **Commodity Price Fluctuations:** Reserve estimates are highly sensitive to long-term gold and copper price assumptions. If market prices rise, lower-grade or previously uneconomic mineralization can become economically viable and be reclassified as reserves. Conversely, sustained price drops can render some reserves uneconomic, reducing reported figures[1] [2] [3] [4].
- **Economic Assumptions:** Changes in costs for fuel, labor, equipment, and environmental compliance—often driven by broader market trends—can shift the cut-off grade and impact the volume of ore classified as reserves[2] [5] [4].

## Technological Advances

- **Resource Discovery and Modeling:** Innovations such as AI-driven data analysis, advanced geophysical imaging (e.g., muon tomography), and machine learning can identify new mineralization, improve geological models, and reduce uncertainty in reserve estimates. These tools can help discover deeper or more complex ore bodies, leading to upward revisions in reserves[6] [7] [8] [9].
- **Precision Mining Techniques:** Technologies like sensor-enabled precision drilling and advanced ore sorting enable more efficient extraction, reduce waste, and can make lower-grade ore bodies economically viable. This can increase the amount of ore classified as reserves and extend mine life[6] [10].
- **Processing Improvements:** Advances in metallurgical processing, real-time ore characterization, and selective extraction can improve recovery rates, making it possible to economically process ores that were previously marginal or uneconomic[10].

## Combined Impact

- **Dynamic Reserve Estimates:** Reserve estimates are not static; they are regularly updated to reflect new market realities and technological capabilities. Sensitivity testing and periodic re-estimation are industry best practices to ensure that reserve figures remain accurate and relevant in changing conditions[1] [3] [4].
- **Unlocking Previously Inaccessible Resources:** As technology advances, ore bodies that were too deep, low-grade, or complex to mine profitably may become viable, leading to substantial increases in reserve estimates[7] [10].

**In summary:**  
Both market and technological advances are powerful drivers that can either increase or decrease reserve estimates, sometimes dramatically. Companies that adopt new technologies and adapt to market changes are best positioned to realize the full value of their mineral assets[6] [7] [10].
