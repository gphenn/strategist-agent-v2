# What is the estimated present day value of maritime and firefly metals gold and copper reserves on the Baie Verte peninsula?

The **present-day estimated value** of Maritime Resources’ and FireFly Metals’ gold and copper reserves on the Baie Verte peninsula is approximately **$1.30 trillion USD**. This estimate is based on current market prices and the most recent reserve/resource figures for each company:

| Company             | Metal   | Reserve/Resource Estimate            | Price (July 2025)       | Present Value (USD)       |
|---------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Maritime Resources  | Gold    | 272,000 ounces                       | $3,338/oz[1] [2]         | $907,936,000              |
| FireFly Metals      | Copper  | 30.2 million tonnes @ 1.81% Cu       | $9,835/tonne[3]         | $5,376,008,000            |
| FireFly Metals      | Gold    | ~387,200,000 ounces (in copper ore)* | $3,338/oz[1] [2]         | $1,290,337,000,000         |

*Calculated from FireFly’s copper resource tonnage and average gold grade (0.4 g/t).

- **Total combined estimated value:** **$1,296,621,000,000** (about $1.30 trillion USD).

**Key notes:**

- These figures represent in-situ metal values and do not account for recovery rates, mining/processing costs, royalties, or other economic factors that would affect actual realized value.
- FireFly’s gold figure is derived from the gold content within its copper ore, not standalone gold deposits.
- Both companies are actively drilling and expanding their resources, so these numbers may increase with future exploration success[4] [5] [6] [7].

**Summary:**  
At current gold and copper prices, the Baie Verte peninsula hosts reserves/resources for Maritime and FireFly Metals with a combined estimated gross value of about **$1.30 trillion USD**, overwhelmingly dominated by FireFly’s gold content within its copper-gold ore.
