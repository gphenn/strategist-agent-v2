# What products and aggregate types does Shoreline supply

Shoreline Aggregates’ core product lines are fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, base aggregate, and rip rap, all produced from gabbro and similar hard rock sources suitable for asphalt, concrete, and heavy civil works.[^1][^2][^3]

## Main aggregate categories

- Fine aggregate: Manufactured sands and small-size crushed material used in asphalt and concrete mixes.[^2][^3]
- Coarse aggregate: Larger stone fractions used in concrete, drainage layers, and structural fills.[^3][^2]
- Base aggregate: Dense, well‑graded crushed rock for road base, pavement structure, and heavy‑duty pads.[^4][^5][^3]
- Rip rap: Large rock blocks used for shoreline protection, erosion control, and heavy armouring.[^6][^1][^3]


## Material sources and suitability

- Point Rousse Quarry gabbro: Marketed as particularly suitable for asphalt, base materials, rip rap, and armour stone.[^1]
- South Brook and other quarries: Provide additional hard‑rock sources for similar base, structural, and protection applications.[^4][^1]


## End uses and certifications

- Asphalt and concrete products: Shoreline explicitly positions its aggregates for asphalt mixes, ready‑mix concrete, and precast uses in export markets.[^2][^3]
- Infrastructure and coastal works: Products are qualified in some U.S. state DOT lists for use in asphalt, base, and rip rap applications, indicating compliance with transportation and construction specifications.[^6][^2]
