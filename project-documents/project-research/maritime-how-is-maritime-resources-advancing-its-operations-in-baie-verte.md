# How is Maritime Resources advancing its operations in Baie Verte

Maritime Resources is **advancing its operations in Baie Verte** through a multi-pronged strategy focused on mine development, processing infrastructure, and regional exploration:

- **Hammerdown Gold Project Advancement**: Maritime has completed a **grade control drill program** over the first year of planned open-pit mining at Hammerdown, with positive results confirming the resource model and supporting mine planning. The project is fully permitted, and the company is targeting development and initial cash flow in 2025[1] [4].

- **Pine Cove Mill Re-commissioning and Processing**: The company acquired the Pine Cove mill and in-pit tailings storage facility as part of the Point Rousse Project. In 2025, Maritime began **processing mineralized stockpiles** at Pine Cove, generating its first gold production from existing materials. The mill has undergone significant **equipment upgrades, mechanical and electrical inspections, and recruitment of experienced personnel** to ensure efficient and safe operations. Investments are ongoing to improve material handling and grinding circuits to prepare for Hammerdown ore[1] [6].

- **Stockpile and Tailings Processing**: Maritime has identified and is processing **85,000–115,000 tonnes of mineralized stockpiles and tailings**, grading about 1.1 grams per tonne gold, for an estimated 3,000–4,000 ounces of contained gold. This provides early cash flow and operational ramp-up ahead of Hammerdown’s full-scale mining[6].

- **Strategic Partnerships and Financing**: The company has secured **$20 million in equity financing** to fund development, and has established partnerships with other regional players such as New Found Gold and Firefly Metals to leverage infrastructure and operational synergies[1] [4] [5].

- **Land Position and Exploration**: Maritime controls over **439–450 km²** of highly prospective land in the Baie Verte mining district, including the Green Bay, Whisker Valley, Gull Ridge, and Point Rousse projects. This extensive land package positions the company for future growth through exploration and potential new discoveries[3] [10].

- **Sustainable Operations and Community Engagement**: The company is working with local contractors and partners (e.g., Shoreline Aggregates) for reclamation and tailings management, and is committed to responsible environmental practices and local employment[6] [9].

In summary, Maritime Resources is rapidly advancing its Baie Verte operations by bringing the Hammerdown Gold Project toward production, re-commissioning and upgrading the Pine Cove mill, processing stockpiled material for early cash flow, expanding its exploration footprint, and leveraging strategic partnerships and financing to support sustainable, long-term growth[1] [4] [6].
