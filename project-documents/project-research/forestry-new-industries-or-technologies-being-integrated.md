# New Industries and Technologies in the Forestry Revitalization Plan

## Emerging Industries

- **Bioenergy and Biofuels**
  - Development of wood pellet plants and biomass energy facilities is underway, with projects such as a $19.7 million wood pellet plant planned for Hawke’s Bay. These initiatives use forestry by-products like chips, bark, and sawdust to generate renewable energy and biofuels, including advanced products like black pellets that can substitute for coal in energy production[1] [2].
- **Value-Added Wood Products**
  - Sawmills are diversifying into engineered wood products, finger-jointed lumber, and pressure-treated wood. Investments in specialized sawing lines allow the use of small-diameter wood, previously considered waste, for new products such as long-length lumber and commercial firewood[3].
- **Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs)**
  - There is growing commercial interest in harvesting and processing non-timber resources such as berries, mushrooms, and medicinal plants, creating new opportunities for local entrepreneurship and export[2].

## Integrated Technologies

- **Biomass Dryers and Co-Generation**
  - Sawmills are adopting biomass dryers to process waste materials, which are then used for energy generation in facilities like the Corner Brook Pulp and Paper Limited co-generation plant. This technology reduces waste and adds value to by-products[3].
- **Innovative Harvesting and Processing**
  - New technologies include specialized saw lines for small-diameter wood, finger-jointing equipment for producing longer lumber, and advanced pressure-treating systems. These upgrades improve efficiency and expand the range of marketable products[3].
- **Digital and Environmental Monitoring**
  - The sector is exploring wireless sensor networks for real-time forest monitoring, which supports adaptive management and sustainable harvesting practices[4].
- **Circular Bioeconomy Applications**
  - The circular bioeconomy model is being implemented, emphasizing full resource utilization. This includes converting forestry residues into bioproducts such as biochar, bioplastics, and specialty chemicals, supporting both environmental and economic goals[2].

## Workforce and Skills Development

- **Training for the Bioeconomy**
  - New training programs are being developed to equip workers with the skills needed for bioenergy, advanced wood processing, and digital monitoring technologies. Special focus is placed on including underrepresented groups such as women, Indigenous peoples, and youth in the evolving forest sector[5] [2].
