# Maritime Gold Company Operations in Baie Verte, Newfoundland

**Maritime Resources Corp.** is a gold exploration and development company with significant operations in the Baie Verte mining district of Newfoundland and Labrador. The company’s activities are centered around the Hammerdown Gold Project and supported by a robust portfolio of exploration and processing assets in the region.

## Key Projects and Assets

- **Hammerdown Gold Project**:
  - Located near the towns of King’s Point and Springdale, Hammerdown is the company’s flagship development. The site was a past-producing underground mine (2000–2004) that yielded 133,000 ounces of gold. Maritime Resources is now advancing plans to restart Hammerdown as a high-grade open pit operation, with a projected mine life of five years and annual production estimates of around 50,000 ounces [1] [2].
  - The project is fully permitted, with all major environmental and operational approvals in place. Development, ramp-up, and initial cash flow are targeted for the second half of 2025 [3] [4].
  - Recent grade control drilling has confirmed high-grade gold at surface, including notable intersections such as 49.4 grams per tonne (g/t) gold over 2.6 metres and 12.0 g/t gold over 28.0 metres, underscoring the project’s strong resource potential[3] [5].

- **Processing Facilities**:
  - Maritime owns and operates two key mineral processing assets in the Baie Verte district: the Pine Cove mill and the Nugget Pond gold circuit. The Pine Cove mill has recently been recommissioned and began processing mineralized stockpiles in early 2025, marking the first gold recovery under Maritime’s ownership[3] [4] [6].
  - The company is investing in upgrades to the Pine Cove mill, including enhancements to the material handling and grinding circuits, to optimize processing for Hammerdown ore[4].

- **Exploration Portfolio**:
  - Maritime controls over 439–450 km² of prospective land in the Baie Verte area, including the Green Bay, Whisker Valley, Gull Ridge, and Point Rousse projects. This region is geologically significant, hosting numerous past-producing mines and current development projects for gold and copper[7] [3].
  - The company’s properties are strategically situated along major regional fault systems (Baie Verte Fault Line and Green Bay Fault), which are believed to have played a crucial role in the formation of high-grade gold deposits[7].

## Financial and Operational Highlights

- Maritime recently closed a $20 million equity financing, providing the capital needed for project development and operational ramp-up at a time of record gold prices[3].
- The Hammerdown project’s 2022 technical report outlined proven and probable reserves of 272,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 4.46 g/t, with robust project economics—an after-tax net present value (NPV) of C$103 million (at $1,750/oz gold) and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 48%. At higher gold prices, the NPV and IRR are even more favorable[1].

## Outlook

Maritime Resources is well-positioned for near-term production and cash flow, with fully permitted assets, a strong exploration pipeline, and significant processing infrastructure in place. The company’s focus on the Baie Verte mining district leverages the region’s established mining infrastructure and favorable geology, supporting its strategy for sustainable growth and value creation[3] [4] [7].

In summary, Maritime Resources Corp. is advancing one of Newfoundland’s most promising gold development projects, with operations in Baie Verte poised to contribute significantly to regional gold output in the coming years.
