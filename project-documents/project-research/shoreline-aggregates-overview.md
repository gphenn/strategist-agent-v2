# What can you tell me about a company called Shoreline in the town of Baie Verte, Newfoundland

Shoreline in Baie Verte is almost certainly Shoreline Aggregates Inc., an aggregate (crushed rock/stone) producer and exporter based on the Baie Verte Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador.[^1][^2]

## What Shoreline Does

Shoreline Aggregates manufactures and exports stone aggregate products (base, fine and coarse aggregates, rip rap) used in asphalt, concrete, and infrastructure projects.  The company specializes in large‑scale crushing operations and customized bulk aggregate products, shipping by vessel from its quarrying and port facilities at Port Rousse, near Baie Verte.[^2][^3][^4][^5][^1]

## Location and Scale

The company is headquartered in Baie Verte, with a listed address around 325 Highway 410 and operations on the Baie Verte/Point Rousse Peninsula.  Public profiles indicate it is a privately held firm, founded in 2016, with roughly 50–200 employees, making it a significant local industrial employer.[^6][^7][^8][^5][^9][^2]

## Markets and Exports

Shoreline focuses on export markets, supplying aggregates to the eastern United States, Gulf States, Caribbean, and other international customers.  In its first year of large‑scale operation, the company reports crushing and shipping over 2.8 million tonnes of base rock to Charleston, South Carolina, creating dozens of direct jobs in the region.[^10][^11][^5][^9][^1]

## Sustainability and Innovation

Shoreline emphasizes sustainable resource use, aiming to minimize waste and carbon footprint, and is noted in local and industry sources for circular‑economy style projects that repurpose mine waste rock and tailings.  The company is involved in regional mining and economic development initiatives on the Baie Verte Peninsula and appears linked with other local resource and construction firms such as Guy J. Bailey Ltd. and BAIE Minerals.[^11][^7][^12][^9][^1][^2][^10]

## How It Fits Locally

Within the Baie Verte mining district, Shoreline is one of the active players alongside mineral exploration and mining companies, contributing to employment and demand for skilled labour in the area.  Its presence builds on the peninsula’s long mining history by shifting some activity toward aggregate export and value‑added use of waste rock rather than only traditional metal mining.[^13][^14][^9][^10]
