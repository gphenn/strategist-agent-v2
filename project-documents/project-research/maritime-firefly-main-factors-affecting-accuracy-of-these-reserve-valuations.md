# What are the main factors affecting the accuracy of these reserve valuations

The **accuracy of reserve valuations** for Maritime Resources and FireFly Metals on the Baie Verte peninsula is influenced by several key factors:

- **Commodity Price Volatility:** Gold and copper prices fluctuate daily due to global economic conditions, central bank policies, geopolitical events, inflation, and market sentiment. Valuations based on current prices can change significantly with shifts in these factors[1] [2] [3].

- **Resource Classification and Confidence:** Not all reported resources are equally certain. Proven and probable reserves are more reliable than measured, indicated, or inferred resources. Early-stage or inferred resources carry much greater uncertainty, which can lead to over- or under-estimation[4] [5].

- **Geological and Technical Uncertainty:** The accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quality and density of drilling data, geological modeling, and understanding of deposit controls (structure, lithology, mineralogy, etc.). Incomplete or optimistic modeling can misrepresent the actual size, grade, or continuity of the ore body[4].

- **Metallurgical Recovery Rates:** Not all contained metal can be economically or technically recovered. Recovery rates depend on ore characteristics and processing technology, and optimistic assumptions can inflate valuations[4].

- **Economic and Regulatory Assumptions:** Valuations often assume current mining costs, tax regimes, environmental regulations, and permitting conditions will remain stable. Changes in any of these can materially alter the economic viability and thus the value of reserves[5] [4].

- **Discounting and Time Value:** In-situ values do not account for the time required to develop, mine, and process the reserves. The net present value (NPV) of a deposit can be much lower than its gross metal value due to discounting future cash flows.

- **Market Accessibility and Infrastructure:** The ability to monetize reserves depends on access to infrastructure (mills, ports, roads), regulatory approvals, and market demand. Delays or obstacles can reduce the practical value of reserves[5] [4].

In summary, **reserve valuations are inherently uncertain and sensitive to a wide range of geological, technical, economic, and market factors**. Gross in-situ values often overstate the actual economic value that can be realized from a deposit[5] [4] [3].
