# Has Shoreline raised external funding or investors

Public information does not show Shoreline Aggregates having outside equity investors in the usual venture capital or private‑equity sense; it is described as a privately held company closely tied to Guy J. Bailey Ltd. as its contract mining partner and affiliate.[^1][^2][^3]

## Ownership and structure

Profiles list Shoreline Aggregates Inc. as “privately held,” with no disclosures of institutional equity owners or public share listings, which strongly suggests ownership is in private hands rather than external funds.  Industry articles describe Shore Line Aggregates as a subsidiary or affiliated entity associated with Guy J. Bailey Ltd., indicating a closely held, contractor‑linked structure rather than a funded startup.[^2][^3][^1]

## Non‑equity support and contributions

There is public evidence of Shoreline providing capital to others, not the reverse: for example, Shoreline advanced 1 million Canadian dollars to support Maritime Resources Corp.’s acquisition of Point Rousse Mining Inc., in exchange for access rights and operating arrangements on the property.  Shoreline has also received a repayable government contribution under a regional business scale‑up and productivity program, which is a form of non‑equity financing but not outside ownership.[^4][^5][^6]
