# The Acquisition of the Hammerdown Gold Project

New Found Gold’s acquisition of Maritime Resources – and with it the Hammerdown Gold Project, Pine Cove mill, and the Nugget Pond hydrometallurgical gold circuit – is essentially about securing processing capacity, near‑term cash flow, and a ready‑made operating platform to de‑risk and fund Queensway.[1][2]

## What was acquired  

The Maritime deal folds three key assets into New Found Gold’s “Hammerdown Division”: the Hammerdown open‑pit mine near Baie Verte, the fully permitted Pine Cove mill in the same district, and access to the Nugget Pond hydrometallurgical gold plant.[3][1]
Hammerdown is ramping up with ore trucked to Pine Cove, while Pine Cove and Nugget Pond together provide roughly 700–1,000 tpd plus a separate hydrometallurgical gold circuit already licensed and operating in Newfoundland.[4][5][6]

## Role of Pine Cove mill  

The Pine Cove mill is the workhorse for Hammerdown ore and a future toll‑milling hub for Queensway’s early high‑grade feed.[7][1]
Queensway’s PEA explicitly contemplated initial off‑site toll milling at a 700 tpd facility in Newfoundland; by owning Pine Cove, New Found locks in that capacity, cuts counterparty risk, and shortens schedule and capex compared to building a new plant from day one.[2][8][4]

## Role of Nugget Pond plant  

Nugget Pond provides a permitted hydrometallurgical circuit capable of treating gold concentrates or refractory material, giving optionality in how Queensway and Hammerdown ores are processed over time.[5][1]
Control of this circuit lets New Found optimize flowsheets (e.g., gravity/flotation at Pine Cove, concentrate finishing at Nugget Pond) without relying on third‑party smelters or custom mills, which can materially improve margins and flexibility under different gold price and grade scenarios.[5][7]

## How this fits their strategy  

Strategically, the Maritime acquisition turns New Found from a single‑asset explorer into a multi‑asset, near‑term producer where Hammerdown/Pine Cove/Nugget Pond generate cash flow before Queensway’s Phase 1 start in 2027.[9][2][4]
Management and external commentary emphasize three pillars: using Hammerdown cash flow to fund a “material portion” of Queensway capex, using Pine Cove/Nugget Pond to execute the PEA’s low‑capex toll‑milling start‑up concept, and leveraging shared infrastructure and teams across central and Baie Verte district assets to build a scalable Newfoundland‑focused gold producer.[1][3][7][9]
