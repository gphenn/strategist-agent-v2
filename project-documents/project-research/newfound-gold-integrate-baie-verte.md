New Found Gold is positioning Baie Verte as a second operating hub in Newfoundland – a “Hammerdown Division” that generates early cash flow, houses key processing infrastructure, and complements the longer‑life Queensway mine near Gander.[1][2][3]

## Baie Verte as an operating hub  

The Maritime acquisition gives New Found Gold a fully permitted, near‑term producing mine at Hammerdown in the Baie Verte mining district, plus the Pine Cove mill and Nugget Pond gold circuit.[3][4][1]
Corporate materials now describe the company as having Queensway plus a distinct Maritime/Hammerdown Division, signalling Baie Verte is intended to be a permanent operating centre rather than a one‑off satellite asset.[5][6][3]

## Cash flow to fund Queensway  

Hammerdown in Baie Verte is targeted to ramp to full production in early 2026 at roughly 50,000 oz/year at relatively low all‑in sustaining costs, generating meaningful free cash flow.[2][7]
New Found explicitly frames those Baie Verte cash flows as covering a “material portion” of Queensway Phase 1 capex, smoothing financing needs and reducing dilution while Queensway moves toward its own planned 2027 start.[8][9][1]

## Infrastructure and processing role  

Baie Verte hosts the Pine Cove mill and Nugget Pond hydrometallurgical gold plant circuit, which New Found plans to use not only for Hammerdown ore but also as toll‑milling/processing capacity for early Queensway production, consistent with the PEA’s low‑capex start‑up concept.[4][10][3]
Having this infrastructure 180 km from Queensway allows the company to phase development: start with trucking selected high‑grade material to Baie Verte facilities, then later build a larger on‑site plant at Queensway once production is established and funded.[7][11][1]

## Regional platform and workforce  

By anchoring operations in both Baie Verte and central Newfoundland, New Found Gold aims to create a regional gold platform with shared services, contractors, and a local workforce across two established mining districts.[11][12]
Analyst commentary and company messaging highlight that this dual‑hub footprint improves economies of scale, supports future consolidation opportunities in Newfoundland, and enhances the company’s profile as a multi‑asset “emerging Canadian gold producer” rather than a single‑project explorer.[13][5][11]
