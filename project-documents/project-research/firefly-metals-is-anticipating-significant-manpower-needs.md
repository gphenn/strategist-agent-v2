# Firefly Metals is anticipating significant manpower needs as it expands and develops its Baie Verte area projects

Firefly Metals is anticipating significant manpower needs as it expands and develops its Baie Verte area projects, particularly the Green Bay Copper-Gold Project and the Ming Mine. While precise employee numbers have not been publicly disclosed, several indicators point to substantial workforce requirements:

- **Job Creation and Economic Growth:** Firefly’s expansion and planned restart of the Ming Mine are expected to generate numerous jobs for local residents, supporting both underground and surface operations. Community feedback has highlighted strong interest in employment opportunities, and Firefly has integrated these priorities into its development planning[3].

- **Operational Scale:** The company is undertaking a massive 130,000-meter drilling program, with four rigs currently operating underground and 40,000 meters already completed as of early 2025. This level of exploration and development activity requires a large team of geologists, drill operators, engineers, and support staff[3].

- **Expansion Infrastructure:** The proposed project expansion includes new underground mining infrastructure, a processing plant, a tailings management facility, roads, transmission lines, storage, and accommodations. This will necessitate a broad range of skilled trades, construction workers, plant operators, maintenance personnel, and logistics staff[4].

- **Safety and Management Roles:** Firefly is actively recruiting for key leadership positions such as a Senior Safety Manager, responsible for overseeing site safety, compliance, training, and risk management. This role alone involves managing a safety team and ensuring rigorous safety protocols for all personnel, reflecting the scale and complexity of the workforce needed[2].

- **Community Engagement and Diversity:** Firefly is committed to hiring locally and fostering a diverse workforce, encouraging applications from underrepresented groups and newcomers to Canada[2] [3].

- **Accommodation and Support Services:** With plans for on-site accommodations, the company will also require hospitality, catering, and administrative staff to support a residential workforce[4].

**In summary:**
Firefly Metals expects to employ a substantial and diverse workforce—including miners, engineers, tradespeople, safety professionals, management, and support staff—to meet the demands of its expanded mining operations in Baie Verte. The scale of drilling, construction, and production activities signals hundreds of direct jobs, with additional indirect employment likely through local suppliers and service providers[3] [4] [2].
