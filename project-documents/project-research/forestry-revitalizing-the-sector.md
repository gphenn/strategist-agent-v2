# Revitalizing the Forestry Sector on the Baie Verte Peninsula

## Diversification Efforts

- **Product Expansion:** The government and industry are encouraging the development of new forest-based products beyond traditional saw logs and pulpwood. This includes engineered wood products, wood pellets, and other value-added goods that can serve domestic and export markets.
- **Non-Timber Forest Products:** There is growing interest in harvesting and commercializing non-timber resources such as berries, mushrooms, and medicinal plants, which can supplement traditional forestry revenues and support local entrepreneurship.
- **Bioenergy and Bioproducts:** Initiatives are underway to use forest biomass for renewable energy (e.g., wood chips and pellets for heating) and to develop bioproducts such as biochar, bioplastics, and specialty chemicals, helping to reduce waste and create new economic opportunities.

## Improved Resource Access

- **Timber Allocation:** The province has adjusted timber allocations to ensure that local operators and new entrants can access sufficient raw material. This is intended to support both existing sawmills and new businesses interested in innovative forest products.
- **Infrastructure Investments:** Upgrades to forest access roads and support for modern harvesting equipment are being prioritized to improve the efficiency and safety of forestry operations, making it easier for businesses to utilize available resources.

## Development of a Circular Bioeconomy

- **Waste Utilization:** The circular bioeconomy approach emphasizes using all parts of the harvested trees, minimizing waste. By-products from sawmilling and logging (such as bark, chips, and sawdust) are increasingly being used for energy generation, compost, and other secondary products.
- **Sustainable Practices:** The government promotes sustainable forest management, including reforestation, ecosystem protection, and long-term planning, to ensure that forestry activities contribute to both economic and environmental goals.
- **Collaboration and Innovation:** Partnerships among government, industry, academic institutions, and Indigenous communities are fostering research and pilot projects aimed at new bio-based industries, such as advanced wood processing and bioenergy demonstration sites.
